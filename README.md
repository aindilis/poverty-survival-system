Poverty Survival System

http://frdcsa.org/frdcsa/minor/poverty-survival-system

This is the code for an assistive system to make it easier to bear the
burden of being in an impoverished condition.  As they say, being poor
is expensive.  Originally we had planned to maybe charge people a
miniscule rate to use the Free Life Planner, but fortunately had a
better idea which is to offer to people who have (re)gained financial
security through the security of the Free Life Planner to donate from
their abundance to help improve the system to be able to help other
people in similarly difficult situations.

The system is mainly to provide logistics services via free cell
phones to the homeless to prevent exposure to the elements, and all
the other fun things that being homeless entails.  However, the system
is universally applicable to all people.

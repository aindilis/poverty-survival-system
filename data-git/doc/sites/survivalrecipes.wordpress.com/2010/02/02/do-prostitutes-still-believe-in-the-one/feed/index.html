Aside from that, since human beings are more nurture than nature, it is essential to look inward at where your problems originated; that is what it means to be a self-improving guru.


Not sure what you mean by hookers and &quot;the one&quot; though. A prostitute is someone who&#039;s self-esteem is so broken that they are willing to do what should be an intimate act for money.
Maybe what you need is to take a break from relationships altogether, and stop finding rebound girls (sorry for being so blunt). After every failed relationship, it is tempting to immediately find another, but important to step back and learn lessons from the experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve thought about you often and still have the pictures I took of you and the Oklahoma girl you rescued.  I&#039;m sorry to see you are having such a hard time.

I guess you finally broke free of the net because you haven&#039;t been on for a while.  I&#039;m hooked on it too, way too much time I spend on it.  It&#039;s my &quot;avoidance&quot; tool of choice.  As long as I&#039;m busy on here doing something I don&#039;t have to do the stuff I don&#039;t want to do or is too overwhelming.

So if you are a loser so am I.  

Personally I don&#039;t think you are a loser I think you are still &#039;evolving&#039; like everything and everyone else who is alive.   Life isn&#039;t where you &quot;arrive&quot; or you &quot;get it&quot;.  And even if you did arrive or get it, the rules are always subject to changing.  

So I say you adapt as time goes by  ON YOUR WAY to somewhere.  The fact you don&#039;t think you&#039;re there yet doesn&#039;t do any disservice to who you are now.  You&#039;re like the evolving butterfly, still changing, still growing, still learning.

And as long as you are still learning then you aren&#039;t dead.  You&#039;re just you on the way.]]></description>

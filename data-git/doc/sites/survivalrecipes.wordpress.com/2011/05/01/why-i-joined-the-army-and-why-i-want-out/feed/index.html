		<description><![CDATA[It is easy to blame capitalism and the free market for societal ills. But what many forget is that government interference is all pervading; we have never, ever had a truly free market. Free exchange (absent top-down imposition of the rulers will) is the most effective possible means of allocating resources and creating new technologies.
(in fact, many people forget that a &quot;corporation&quot; is a legal status created by the government, specifically intended to protect rich elites from consequences)

If you are interested, www.freedomainradio.com has a lot on this. A theory is that since a truly free market has yet to exist, it will not look like the society we live in now.
Aside from that, I greatly appreciate your advice; I plan on going homeless soon, and you have helped me be that much more prepared.]]></description>

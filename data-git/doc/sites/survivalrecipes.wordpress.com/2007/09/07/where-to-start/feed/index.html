Take both say thank you and put them in your car.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re planning such a venture, you might would be better served to consider Army Surplus.

After all, the &quot;grunts&quot; and &quot;leathernecks&quot; live months to years out of their backpacks.  That&#039;s what this stuff is designed for.

Once you hit the skidds you won&#039;t be able to get good quality equipment and you&#039;ll have to settle for what you can scrounge.

GOOD LUCK BROTHERS AND SISTERS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m homeless in a major city that has a weekly events paper. I scan the paper religiously for &quot;free&quot; events where &quot;refreshments will be served.&quot; I dress the part. Prepare some small talk and fill my plate.

Art gallery opening receptions, lectures, college events, church events, conferences things like this you can really fill the stomach. Make an initial pass at the refreshment table. Chat with others. Make another pass. Chat with others. Then go to the next venue. Repeat.

I&#039;ve seen one other gentlemen on the event circuit who seems to be up to the same thing as me and we give each other a grin.

Also, I work as a television and movie extra on occasion. Craft services can really smooth out the rough edges. I follow my art gallery routine. Fill a plate. Walk away to chit chat. Then fill another plate. Granola bars go into my pocket for later.

I do soup kitchens (they often give a to-go bag) and food pantries.

Once I really understood the concept of survival mode, I became creative.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The P-38 can opener is invaluable. This is the smallest can opener made. Army surplus stores and Wal-Mart carry them. Dented cans are often found at grocery store dumpsters. Many churches have a food pantry that you can go to once a month and get a bag of food which will include some canned goods. Stash the canned goods in a plastic bag in a dry hidden location and come back for it when you have eaten all the other items. Get a list from Salvation Army of all the food pantries and what there requirements are. Some a very liberal and some are very stringent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heard somewhere that Colonel Sanders once had a son who was homeless or a wanderer or something but if you go to a KFC today and ask the manager for one piece of chicken it&#039;s company policy to give you one.  I never tried it so don&#039;t know if it&#039;s true.  Never hurts to ask.]]></description>

Thank you,

		<description><![CDATA[I was lucky enough to have a job that pays cash everyday with a bathroom outside. Tho my boss leaves it locked at night I am able to wash up during the day and sleep behind the building at night out of the cameras. My only issue now is the cold... It&#039;s in the low 30s right now and I&#039;m so scared of hypothermia.  Any suggestions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely agree w J and Hawklover,

Though think like anything it can depend on what work someone can find. No matter what, trying to secure some income should be a goal. Regardless of living accommodations trying to build up some cash reserves seems to me to be really important. So guess employment will dictate a persons schedule to great extent.

Have been homeless before for 1yr ... dead of winter midwest. Lucked out and found a commercial building that was pretty much abandoned and stayed there. Backdoor was already downed, though if I&#039;dve been caught nobody would&#039;ve believed I&#039;d found it that way, Ah ... guess could&#039;ve still tried for reasonable doubt or whatever.

Facing homelessness again. This time around decided to go with Hawklovers approach. Google maps, switch to satellite view and look for wooded areas. Worth noting any you come across while traveling too and think it&#039;s important to actually inspect these places on site. A satellite isn&#039;t going to tell someone actual conditions of the location(s), changes from time the images were taken etc so forth. A couple that looked good on satellite turned out to be golf courses ( country clubs.) That&#039;dve turned out great, having some retired dentist wanting to play through my camp. :)

Am still focused on work prospects and so choosing a site that within a reasonable distance of as many businesses as possible is an important consideration for me. A person walks on avg 3mi per hour, so for me figuring that gives me about a 3mi radius around the urban camp sites I&#039;ve evaluated. The public library here as a subscription to a bunch of databases, one of those is called reference USA and a person can search businesses by many criteria, one of them being by radius around a given address. Helped me zero in on businesses within walking distance to put in apps and see how many prospects are within x-radius of a camp site.

Personally do think it&#039;s a good idea to scout out more than one. If at all possible stash/cache some supplies. ( Clothing = get the stuff via local help agencies if necessary. Many will give a person down on their luck some vouchers. Some food stores, hopefully even a tent and some tarps whatever other supplies.) Someone could rotate them occasionally to break up routine. People may tend to notice a pattern of a person constantly coming going to the point they stick out. Coming and going via the same routes can also leave noticeable tracks. Such fallback sites gives someone ... someplace to fall back to if for whatever reason a preferred urban camp can&#039;t be used. Doesn&#039;t leave a person with all eggs in 1 basket.

Here and am sure in many other places seems to be plenty of patches of woods along railroad tracks, side of highways and just me but tended to look for those located within industrial or business zoned areas. Less residential buildings and hoping more employment prospects. Though have seen patches behind many businesses in this city that appear dense enough to work too. Kind of close to residences, so stands to reason more pedestrian traffic.

A tent might not be home but atm it&#039;s my option and beats sleeping on the ground behind a dumpster or nook+cranny I think anyway.  Thanks the author of this site, sucks that folks are going through this but makes people like myself feel a bit less lonely + depressed knowing I&#039;m not alone or the only one. Do feel it&#039;s a good thing to stay positive, whatever we&#039;re going through. Despair and depression are killers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been homeless for two days now.  I have a scooter and scouted the area for a place to sleep and came across a commercial building that was empty and for lease.  I went to the back and found a trash bin area that had three sides of brick and an unlocked gate in front.  One dumpster was there as it could hold three, but since there was only a dentist in the building, there was one.  This left plenty of room for me to wheel the scooter in, reposition the dumpster so that no one could see me, and I slept on the ground.  I used bug spray from the 99 cent store to keep the bugs away, found some cardboard and used two of my towels for padding.  It has worked great so far. I get there at 8:00 p.m., and sleep until 5:00 a.m.  This prevents me from being surprised by the trash truck or any of the people who work for the dentist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oilfield trash
Since my divorce, I find it interesting to go to new places and live off the fat of the land. Generally I just take a backpacking pack with hiking/camp equipment and live out of it. Guess I have an advantage as I do this for fun and not necessity. Having a vehicle is a real bonus to. Mostly for storing gear though. It&#039;s more interesting to stay out and about.  My work schedule is 28/14. &quot;More people should do this!&quot; When at work room and board are paid, when off my time is my own. I live practically footloose and fancy free. Not to mention all the interesting people met along the way. In urban areas If you stay in greenways off the beaten path, Most city people are afraid to venture there during the night. If you play an instrument you can usually hustle up enough money to eat on without ever breaking into your savings. Not to mention all the fishing and hunting you can do within U.S. cities (don&#039;t get caught). It&#039;s actually a rather nice lifestyle. Just watch your back. Not everyone out there has your best interest at heart .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Use Google earth to zoom in to your location and find patches of trees to camp in. Often these will be along stream beds as builders cannot build on top of them. A hammock will let you sleep in areas where a tent can not be pitched. Also a hammock in a public park for a quick afternoon nap is much more excepted than a sleeping bag on the ground.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I Like this Website, It has been very usefull for me, I Recently lost my home, and currently In Car/Homeless, It&#039;s true that walmart Has a safe place to park, but somethimes is not so great, People are nosey and beggin to ask you if you homeless, Especially when you use the public restroom, So I recommend chaning Walmarts from time to time. Also park next to the Big Walmarts were no incoming traffic of people move in or out of the area.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sleep AT NIGHT!! If you ever have hope of finding a job...your interview will be in the DAYTIME,right? If you have any hope of looking as sharp as you can, then it&#039;s gonna be in the daytime! If you are gonna surf the internet at the library then they are open in the ....c&#039;mon say it! DAYTIME!
Now, where to sleep at NIGHT?? 
I&#039;ve never seen a large city park that don&#039;t have darker undisturbed areas at NIGHT! My favorite one have 2 all night convenience stores with bathrooms within 5 minutes walking time.
But LOOK for these sweet sleeping digs in the...DAYTIME! You need to be able to check out details like street lights, windows from where you might be seen? can you come and go without ppl seeing you? Cars headlights lighting you up?
Also, sit back during the day and think about where you are...WHERE do the cops NOT drive by at ...NIGHT? Are there trees, bushes? Maybe a park shelter?
My favorite are hiking trails, because everyone ELSE is afraid of them at NIGHT! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been searching the question of where to sleep if I&#039;m homeless for 4 hours now on the web and your answer, although dismal, is the closest to real and practical I&#039;ve come across.  
I have a male friend who has just become homeless and has not found a place or way to sleep for the past 4 days.  I am terrified for him and frantic to find a solution.  (I live too far away to provide shelter.) I now feel like if I can somehow help him make it thru this night I can talk him into sleeping during the day.  Both of us never really thought about sleep during the day.  Conditioning right - one sleeps &quot;at Night&quot;.  
Thanks for helping me think outside the box!]]></description>

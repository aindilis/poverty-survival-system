		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve put all sorts of things In my gas tank. One gallon of used motor oil + four gallons of gasoline  = five gallons in the tank. Scrap the catalytic converter (20 to $50 and up), replace with equal length of pipe ($8 at Autozone), and stretch your fuel with whatever filler is available.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Petrol is harder to come by but diesel is easy! Most trucks don&#039;t have locks on the tanks. A friend of mine always kept a 44gal drum on the back of his 4x4 if he saw a truck parked away from houses it was fair game. Many truck drivers don&#039;t have room for their rigs at their suburban houses so they will park in an industrial area or near a common area near their homes. He would usually not take the whole lot and most of the time the truckie would have so much he wouldn&#039;t miss 15-20gal which would
 keep his 4x4 running for quite a while. The suction thing takes practice and he always kept mentors or gum in his glove compartment for his breath afterward. You have to create suction with your mouth while breathing through your nose. Practice with water. You can get a jiggle siphon if you want to avoid this but its hit and miss if they work. If theres not enough in the tank or your hose is too short its a no go. Have to have a diesel too. If your at risk of becoming homeless it might be something to consider acquiring before the H bomb hits.]]></description>

Don&#039;t suck on a hose. You will get gasoline in your mouth and lungs and cause permanent damage.
If you steal gas you will likely get caught. However if you have 5 gallon can and a siphon hose on hand folks may allow you to take a can full from their tank if you ask.

This is a gravity flow system and the target can must be lower than the source. Put you finger over the end to stop it and then raise the hose above the source and remove it. This will prevent spills.]]></description>

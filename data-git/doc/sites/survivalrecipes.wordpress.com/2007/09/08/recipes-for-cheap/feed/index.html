		<description><![CDATA[Never thought homeless people cooked? Wow???!!! We&#039;re not all useless to ourselves. It takes nothing to make a fire. Find a pot or pan &#038; you can cook anything, plus provide warmth. Many of us DO actually cook. Great comment. That&#039;s all you could offer here?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[pasta with egg-
 cook pasta (penne, spirals, whatever).
drain (dont rinse).  In oil or butter in a pan fry about 4 eggs per pound of pasta until the whites are cooked and the yolks are almost done. Sprinkle salt &#038; pepper (&#038; fines herbes) on the eggs. Combine them with the pasta, breaking up the eggs.  Done and delicious. You can throw in other things too- cheese, veggies (sautee in pan before eggs, then cook eggs with vegs), meat, whatever.

also pasta salad- you just mix pasta and any salad dressing and veggies- cukes, bell peppers,, etc, - grapes, almonds, cheese, hard-boiled egg, whatever you want and it&#039;ll fill you up and taste good.

sriracha hot sauce makes anything tatse better, like rice &#038; beans, though avocado adds to the proteins and fats necessary during lean eating.

great site dude- keep the faith!]]></description>

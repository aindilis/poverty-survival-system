		<description><![CDATA[one of my favorite things to do when it is raining is watching for two rain drops to hit the exact same spot, whether it be in the car on one of the windows, on the pavement, in a puddle.  its just one of those things that amuses me.

reading this makes me want to come find you, bring you back to columbia, and have you stay on my couch for a couple of days, coming and going as you please, and then poof gone again.

but for those couple of days i could feed you or more likely you would have some random groceries from the dumpster and would feed me. hehe]]></description>

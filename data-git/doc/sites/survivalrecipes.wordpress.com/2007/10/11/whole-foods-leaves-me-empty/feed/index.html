		<description><![CDATA[We know that we don&#039;t need pesticides and preservatives and growth hormones and genetically engineered foods, but lots of people don&#039;t. They don&#039;t even know that stuff is in their food or what it is. Or they don&#039;t care. There&#039;s still a market for all that stuff so it will continue to be sold. I do see organic products coming out more, but you&#039;re right, people are lazy. How many people actually cook themselves dinner or breakfast or lunch? How many people look at what they&#039;re feeding themselves? It takes a lot more time and effort and it can take more money, too. I don&#039;t know how many people care enough to make that effort. Maybe if they understood what these things were doing to their bodies they would. But look at how many people smoke or are alcoholics or drug addicts. They know these things are not good for them and even may be killing them but they don&#039;t necessarily stop for that reason. I want to have my own garden so I know what I&#039;m eating. It really does take more time to look at what you&#039;re buying, see if it&#039;s local, and if not, buy only local and get more creative with your meals to substitute with what you have. Around here it&#039;s really helpful because there are tons of organic, local farmers markets and the grocery stores promote carrying local produce. But I&#039;m in the midwest. It wasn&#039;t as easy (not impossible, just harder) to find that in Maryland. There is a market for it, though. I think it will just take time for more and more people to become informed, to find out what it means when they pick up an avocado in their local supermarket that was grown in South Africa. It had to be shipped all the way here. It had to be preserved. That&#039;s no good. Just an example. I&#039;ll stop now because I could continue on this topic forever.]]></description>

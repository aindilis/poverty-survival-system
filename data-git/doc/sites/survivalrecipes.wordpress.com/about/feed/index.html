		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been living in my car for 2 months.  I&#039;m 54, female, and I can&#039;t stand it.  I&#039;ve tried every where for help, and it&#039;s all BS.  I have a housing voucher no one takes, or it&#039;s not enough, so it&#039;s useless.  I&#039;m utterly alone, and I keep thinking of buying a bucket and fill it with bleach and amonia, but I&#039;m afraid I won&#039;t be able to make myself stay in the car long enough.  I&#039;ve posted CL ads for enough pills to do the job, but just get men thinking their cock will solve my problems.  I&#039;m at my wits end.  It&#039;s late June, and I get so hot at night, I soak the car seat, and can&#039;t sleep.  It&#039;s miserable.  Shelters just want me to convert to Christianity, and pray every 10 mins.  Help is appreciated, but brainwashing is not.  I pray, but pray for death that just goes unanswered.  I feel like the high brick walls are just too hard to get over at my age.  Bathrooms and ice water seem to be the biggest challenge each day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When u talked abt keeping ur backpack on u and use a wire thru the zipper add a small bell to it kinda like when some ppl add a small bells to a kitten to keep track of it. 

My hubby and I are recently homeless and ppl just act like we&#039;re the bottom of the bottom and I&#039;m talking about ppl in churches. They judge us all the time and they always tell us &quot;Well we used to help with food vouchers or motel vouchers but the govt stopped giving us the gift cards.&quot; Also they always make us fill out applications and give us a lecture bc after all they&#039;ve arrived. Then they forget that we&#039;re ppl too and we just lost our jobs and we&#039;ve got been thru so much even after careful planning and saving. We&#039;re living in our car and we&#039;ve had to eat a can a beans with a pack of tortillas =$3.00 

And whenever we go to a fast food place before we would usually do get extra napkins, cutlery, salt and pepper, etc. Like from Chik FIL A u can just go in at breakfast u can get free condiments including honey and jelly packs. 

Once we stayed inside a Bojangles talking to somebody while they are and we stayed from 7:00-10:00 p.m. we only drank a soda and we were the last ones in the place and the workers asked if we wanted what they were about to throw away and we said yes! They gave us lots of food to go! 

Also if u hang out at a hospital lobby to get out of the heat or whatever or u might want to just sit in one of their waiting rooms there is FREE coffee, free tea, free hot cocoa and u can even ask the chaplains office if u can have a meal ticket so u can eat from the cafeteria and just make up something like ur visiting someone there and if u know anybody who is in the hospital but can&#039;t afford the meds prescribed ask the chaplains office to help or even a church. 

Also a grocery store called Publix doesn&#039;t charge for some specific prescriptions. 

If u have ever needed an address use a friends address but put ur mail on hold for 30 days at a time so u can maintain an address. Go ahead and pick it up b4 ur 30 days are up and put it back on hold again for 30 days. 

Some libraries can issue u a library card if u use this address on hold. 

Talk to ppl and always be nice bc u will get free info and free stuff. Sometimes we go to free seminars for free food and free stuff and get on email lists for upcoming events. 

Some churches have outreaches with free haircuts and stuff. Keep up with free events around the city with the free newspaper too. 

Got more ideas to share and will come back to this website. I&#039;ve seen some ppl buy a small pack of hot dogs and buns and ask a gas station with a microwave to use to heat up food and reuse a cup to get free ice and water. 

If u go to a food pantry see if they have those powder drink mixes so u can use them at any time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My husband and I have fallen on hard times and it wasnt sudden but happened over the last 4 years. In a few days we will be homeless. We dont know what to do with our belongings. So we are giving them away and selling what we can. We both are not in good health but not old enough for government help I guess. I am legally blind. And my Husband has diabetic ulcerations on his feet. Thats what lost him his job. And nobody wants to hire a blind lady. Anyway we have been researching how to live our of our truck. And to tell you the truth, its going to be a relief! No more worrying about the bills, the rent, etc. I just hope we can do it. And you have certainly given us hope! Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this site- I am newly homeless due to my expartner&#039;s stroke, being his caregiver and his family repaying my kindness by , well , not repaying me at all. Add to that a very well off but very greedy family of my own who discarded me when I reached out. So here I am, dependent on some close friends whilst I rebuild my life. Broke and broken hearted, homeless and homosexual, bilingual and bipolar - what could possibly go wrong?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good idea for those that tent it in the woods like myself (but not in winter) is my idea ( maybe someone already thought of it) is to get 20-30 plastic milk crates only stack them one high and make a big square with them to place the tent onto just to keep from the cold permanating through to the sleeping individual in the tent.I have done this and it works also good to get off of ground when it rains. The milk crates are plentiful at gas stations.I also would suggest building a wood frame to connect tarps to a home made roof to further battle sun and heavy rain . I guess all this if a person is going to be out in a secluded spot in the woods for more than a couple months  alright thanx Im in Minnesota.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would agree.  Due to the &quot;crazy&#039;s&quot; out there, I wouldn&#039;t imagine it&#039;s all that safe for a woman to be travelling in some areas.  As for female needs, as a retired military member who worked in the &quot;field&quot; with women, it brings on difficulties that most men (and women) would not understand (I was a field medic and Reg nurse, so I can at least relate a little).  My wife is retired navy and tells me many stories of problems with hygene and safety.  Not sure anyone other than a women who has lived on the streets for years can give you any answers... good luck and good journey.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m about to become homeless.  I was once this way at 15 for a few months... it was difficult then.  I know more now at 52 years old so i should fare a little better.  Its sort of a relief in some ways... not going to miss to pressures of time that a busy career, home, bills, can place on you.  Only have to last 3 1/2 years and i get a (paid for) government pension at 55 ($1000/mth), then old age security (Canada) at 65.  I should have enought to pay for a room and some food.  Can&#039;t work anymore (disabled from Military) but not disabled enough for pension, just enough to not work at anything i can find.  No problem... time to see the country, do things (that don&#039;t require cash), and just enjoy the sunrise.  Already scoped out shelters for free food in Toronto  :)   And i understand that my federal government and Royal Canadian Legion have just started programs to help Military Veterans that are homeless.  Thanks for all the good advice... post more please.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Afrosty !!!!   it&#039;s Divinitus/Oscar !!!  Much Love on the Absolute Freedom (Homeless) !!!!  I&#039;m creating a community called Divinitus Warrious Universalis = Divine Warriors of the Universe !!!   Where we release our Job, home, apt, condo, house, and focus our energies on becoming the Absolute True Divine Self !!!  it&#039;s a Spiritual Journey to your Absolute True Self, you find out what you&#039;re made of when you Release It All !!!  The Whole Universe is My Home !!!  So to say that I&#039;m &quot;Homeless&quot; is Freaking False !!! Been Absolute Free for over a year now and I never been soo happy in my entire life, I&#039;ve experience Explosive Growth Spiritual, Mind, Body and Spirit !!!  I&#039;m seeking others !!!  to become Divinitus Warrious Universalis, It&#039;s mostly for beings who wants to start absolutely over and to create a whole new life !!!   Where we 100% focus on Mind, Body, Spirit, Infinite Divine Universe &quot;God&quot;, Key qualifications would be that you have a vehicle to sleep and move around in, and that you would have / make enough to pay for gym memberships for the Physical Body Transformation, Yoga, Dance, Bodybuilding, Cardio, basically Everything !!!  all the Group Exercise Classes, where we will Transform and Metamorphosize our Whole Entire Beings... .. I&#039;m currently in the Chicagoland Area (DuPage County to be exact), There is a lot of support for our so called &quot;Homeless&quot; aka Divine Warriors of the Universe !!!!  let me know if anyone is interested or would like more info, if you want to start absolutely over ???  best place is somewhere absolutely New !!!!  I do know what to do and where to go for Our Transformation and Metamorphosizing !!!!  Infinite Love and Gratitude, Divinitus]]></description>

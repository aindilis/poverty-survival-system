		<description><![CDATA[Andy, you are one of the sweetest people I know. I know how you feel living in a &quot;corrupt city&quot;, I mean I lived in Las Vegas. But I never let it get me down. I&#039;m still just me. Can&#039;t wait to see you again. And like Matt said, you&#039;re always welcomed at our place (as soon as it&#039;s done being built).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You always were good at expounding on every little aspect of life in a way that just pulls me in.  Happiness is first and foremost ourselves, then others. Don&#039;t forget to keep in touch, and come visit KS sometime, life moves slower here, and you don&#039;t have to see the smut either. ;)  Take care.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will keep reading, I love your view points and I love your aliteration. Keep being who are, because that is the only reason I love you so much. And just so you know, my house is your house anytime you need a place of refuge (as soon as it is built anyway). Oh and you can call me to vent anytime.]]></description>

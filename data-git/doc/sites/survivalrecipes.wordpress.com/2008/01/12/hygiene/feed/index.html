		<description><![CDATA[*Hygiene For Women: Buy a DIVA CUP! They are a diaphragm type product that collects your flow.  They are easily cleaned with soap and water every 24 hours, or more if needed/wanted.  They come with a cute little baggie to keep them clean when not in use and can easily be kept in your pocket or a pack.  They are reusable for a lifetime and you&#039;ll never have to buy or worry about sanitary products or accidents again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Get a collapsible water bucket from a camping store. Get a magnetic backed locker mirror from the dollar store.
Get a sponge there also. Fill the bucket with warm water and go to the toilet stall and put your mirror up. Shave, brush teeth, wash with the sponge. Use the hand dryer to dry things out a bit before packing up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was in this predicament I did not look homeless.  I didn&#039;t tell people either.  I was lucky to know someone who had a cement garage that locked from inside so I had shelter.  Albeit not super warm, it was much safer than sleeping on the streets.  During this time I would get up each day and walk to the closest hotel to where I stayed.  I would do a sponge bath in the bathroom and even washed my hair in the sink.  Afterwards, I used the hand dryer as a hair dryer to dry my hair.  I didn&#039;t make much of a mess and always made sure it was clean before I left.  In this way I was presentable and able to land a job.

There are usually places like shelters, YWCA&#039;s, and the like that hand out free toothbrushes, brushes and other hygiene items as well.]]></description>

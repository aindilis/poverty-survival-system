		<description><![CDATA[Sorry if I am being blunt, but maybe you are scapegoating?
The internet is little more than a tool; you are responsible for what you do with it. And while it allows you to reach people who live anywhere in the world, that doesn&#039;t mean that relationships are any easier.

My advice is to improve yourself, and the more you do, the more virtuous people will be drawn to you. And virtuous people (as opposed to fake, hypocritical, soul-dead philosophical zombies), are really the only kind of people worth associating with on a personal level.]]></description>

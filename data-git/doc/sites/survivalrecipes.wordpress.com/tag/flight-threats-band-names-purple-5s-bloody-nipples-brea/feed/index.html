				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So a lot of times friends of mine say something stupid that blows my mind, and i think these phrases should be turned into band names.</p>
<p>Since im not musically inclined, tried my luck as a singer and got booed off stage,</p>
<p>feel free to use these if youre looking for a band name</p>
<p>Botched Abortion (stolen from an article in the news paper about a woman who sued her abortion clinic cause when she went she managed to still have the baby.)</p>
<p>Bloody Nipples (ed ed ed, you fascinate me. I think he heard about bloody nipples from a guy he knew who got his nipple rings ripped off in a mosh pit and they squirted everywhere feel free to add the suit part to the end of the band name if you like)</p>
<p>Bloody Bowl Movements (read in a medical book as one of the symptoms of chron&#8217;s disease.)</p>
<p>Kidney Stones (like rolling stones but more cripiling, i had to pee one out at a truck stop in wisconsin, and it was no joke, very metal)</p>
<p>Breast wine ( like &#8220;thats da breast damn wine ive ever tasted!&#8221; but not in this case, no no yet again ed, you figured out somehting no man should, breast milk gone bad, gets babies drunk. Whode of thunk it?)</p>
<p>Flight risk (you know like those people who claim to do something stupid on an ai ro pla ne? Thanks greg)</p>
<p>Purple 5&#8217;s ( as in those new 5 dollar bills with the stupid monopoly looking shit on the back?)</p>
<p>I pooped outside of my diper (maybe a song name, but adams cousin whos 16 months, and managed to poop so much he overfilled his diper.)</p>
<p>more to come&#8230;.</p><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/categories/survivalrecipes.wordpress.com/63/" /> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/tags/survivalrecipes.wordpress.com/63/" /> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/survivalrecipes.wordpress.com/63/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/survivalrecipes.wordpress.com/63/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=survivalrecipes.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1664615&#038;post=63&#038;subd=survivalrecipes&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

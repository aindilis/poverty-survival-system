				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are like most urban dwellers, we would prefer to go to the meat section of any grocery store no matter how pricey to pay for our meat to no longer have a face on it. I am no different. However, having a hungry meat eating large wolfdog to care for these days my funds for raw meat from the grocery store dwindle very fast. So I have been exploring alternatives.</p>
<p>By means of urban rodent hunting with a pellet gun. (Yes I am well aware this is not a good idea ((both to be hunting in an urban neighborhood, and trying to kill animals with a $38 cheap air gun)) but I have managed to do it none the less.</p>
<p>The first thing you have to understand about hunting (as a person who hasnt ever had to hunt, and was never encouraged by your parents or friends to do so) is that you are taking something&#8217;s life, and you had better have a damn good reason to do so. The guilt of that first kill will linger on your conscience for a long time. You will have to look that animal in the eye, feel the warmth leave it&#8217;s body as you &#8220;clean&#8221; it, and if you were a bad shot, you will have to humanly kill it to put it out of its misery.</p>
<p>On the bright side, you get a quick down and dirty first hand look at anatomy, and the mysteries of how the body functions! There is really very little blood contrary to popular belief, and it dosent smell as bad as you would think, (unless of course you hit the stomach or any part of the &#8220;waste&#8221; track).</p>
<p>Also, field cleaning the animal is not rocket science, and is relatively easy to do. if you need help in an urban setting, there are a ton of field dressing videos on youtube and blogs some taught incredibly straightforward and articulately by 12 year olds so don&#8217;t judge.</p>
<p>In the end you have learned a valuable skill which will always be available to you in the future.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind most places in the U.S. require a hunting license, and impose strict fines for not having one, or disobeying the rules associated with it. The good news is they are cheap and easy to obtain, and since most people do not hunt these days your competition is very low.</p>
<p>Good luck, and remember, you should always strive to take your prey in one shot. there is nothing fun or exciting about having to shoot something you maimed again, or know you injured an animal that ran off wounded. So practice practice practice!<a href="https://survivalrecipes.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/13legend-600.jpg"><img id="i-310" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="https://survivalrecipes.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/13legend-600.jpg?w=487" srcset="https://survivalrecipes.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/13legend-600.jpg?w=487 487w, https://survivalrecipes.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/13legend-600.jpg?w=150 150w, https://survivalrecipes.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/13legend-600.jpg?w=300 300w, https://survivalrecipes.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/13legend-600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></a></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/survivalrecipes.wordpress.com/274/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/survivalrecipes.wordpress.com/274/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=survivalrecipes.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1664615&#038;post=274&#038;subd=survivalrecipes&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>voodoo works to heal mental ailments in part because its so abstract one gets sucked into the intensity of the moment and psyccly lapses themselves from whatever mental ailment they had previously been captivated by. this is a religion for the outcasts of society, as all humans need a religion, those who do not feel accepted by the social norm tend to migrate twards such outlandish religions as paganisim and voodoo.</p>
<p>christianity on the other hand is more for the mainstream go with the flow type people, who know murder is wrong, and robbing is a bad idea, maybe not why, but just that it is, and they need a structured yet refined and mundane religon with no whistles and bells, but alows for sin, and the repentance of such.</p>
<p>zen and budisim are religions of ones own mind, and tend to become the religionn of choice for intilectuals. not to be confused with college rebelious intelectuals who find belief in no god is a religion. there has to be some form of a higher power inorder for things to continue to rectcle replenish and renew. having no god is chaos and even in destruction there is creation therefore chaos is simply a predestined reaction brought about by hard to determine cause and effects, theÂ  human brain has yet to understand, and like the mormons say, if there is some controlling higher power we are not allowed to figure out, as it takes away the meaning of life, which is to learn pain and suffering, in order to understand and cherrish love and joy.</p>
<p>my theory is that god and the devil per say are actually one in the same. The being that is god is actually the only being ever to actually intertwine good and evil intraveiniously, and somehow which i havent figured out yet, has formed a contiousness , and wants each and every one of us to be like him/her/it and do our best to learn good and evil are both nessicary in order for there to be continuous rebirth, reincarnation, and the continuation of life in any sense, through evolution or not, as long as we understand good and evil are supposed to coexist. that is infact the meaning of life, to realize good and bad are supposed to merge as one, and from good comes evil, from evil comes good, this is the way of life, and the very basic level of life. this is the only way life can exist, by exchanging one for the other in a violent continuous motion.</p><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/categories/survivalrecipes.wordpress.com/52/" /> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/tags/survivalrecipes.wordpress.com/52/" /> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/survivalrecipes.wordpress.com/52/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/survivalrecipes.wordpress.com/52/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=survivalrecipes.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1664615&#038;post=52&#038;subd=survivalrecipes&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

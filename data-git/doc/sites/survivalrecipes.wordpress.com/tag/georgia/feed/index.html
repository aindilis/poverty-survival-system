				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;AUG Mother Fucker!!!&#8221;  Man I spent nearly 5 years of my post high school pre college life in that hell hole. I made the best of it, and had it not been for Nacho-Mama&#8217;s burrito place, Bryan James Volkey, Johnson, and my car, I&#8217;de have ogne crazy. I finally found out about columbia sc and tiffany and ellen, and stealing bikes, and dumpster diving and breaking the law and being a total rebel in this enviornment, and there were some good times, but mostly it sucked ass.   Wow. Augusta Ga, lost my virginity, my first girlfriend, my first protest, my first home away from home, tons of friends, tons of lonely days where being a hermit was the only way to cope with a fascist government fist carried out by co-workers who felt it was their duty to punish me for everything on the face of the earth, and i rebelled against it all. Oh we all did in some way or another. I remember so much about you augusta, and this is one of the only photos i have of you, and yet, what more do i need? this one explains it all.  Politics, fucking, fucking off, ska hats, leather jackets, homelessness, late nights turning into early mornings, skateboarding, cameras, and hardly anything to show for it except life experiences. Which i suppose is better than most.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God i remember so much just from this one picture, i remember the hangnail gallery, which closed down, the best punk venue ever, i remember bands that played there the intimate mosh pits, the lame ass croud stuck in shitty augusta also, i remember trying to act like i wasnt in the military every where i went and gettin gaway with it, i remember the one and only strip club experiance i ever had with my roomate having to take a dump and it being the only place open, and looking atrocious, </p>
<p>I remember melissa, both of them comming to visit me in my shitty ass dorm room, the crappy pool table, my first real fight, where i nearly got my ass stomped, by my supposed best friend, i remember the friendly talking (barking) fox that visited me on occassion, and how one day he showed up with a wife and kids, and i never saw him agian, </p>
<p>I remember dumpsters filled with treasures almost nightly, i remember finding the suicide journal, and giving it back to its rightful owner, and never hearing back from her, i remember you beth, finding your number in an old address book, and liberating myself from this shit hole through you, and dreams of meeting you in california some day, i remember haivng to go to hooters, cause my friends knew no other place to go on a work night, i remember shamming out of every fucking detail on the planet, i remember asa and chatting about religion all night long, i remember endless nights of youtube and practicing breakdancing, and spending 12 hours 6 days a week, watching green lines turn red, and us turning them green again, i remember talking to you melissa all nigh tlong on the phone, if you called me i got to talk to you for free, im not sure how much it cost you, but, i remember us trying desperately to have sex at work, but it failing, </p>
<p>the radio show in ait, i cant forget that, its all over my old video tapes, the augusta film club with its bunch of misfits, and hasbeens, trying to make a comeback,</p>

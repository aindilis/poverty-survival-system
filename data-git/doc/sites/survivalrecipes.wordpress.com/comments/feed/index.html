		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been living in my car for 2 months.  I&#039;m 54, female, and I can&#039;t stand it.  I&#039;ve tried every where for help, and it&#039;s all BS.  I have a housing voucher no one takes, or it&#039;s not enough, so it&#039;s useless.  I&#039;m utterly alone, and I keep thinking of buying a bucket and fill it with bleach and amonia, but I&#039;m afraid I won&#039;t be able to make myself stay in the car long enough.  I&#039;ve posted CL ads for enough pills to do the job, but just get men thinking their cock will solve my problems.  I&#039;m at my wits end.  It&#039;s late June, and I get so hot at night, I soak the car seat, and can&#039;t sleep.  It&#039;s miserable.  Shelters just want me to convert to Christianity, and pray every 10 mins.  Help is appreciated, but brainwashing is not.  I pray, but pray for death that just goes unanswered.  I feel like the high brick walls are just too hard to get over at my age.  Bathrooms and ice water seem to be the biggest challenge each day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When u talked abt keeping ur backpack on u and use a wire thru the zipper add a small bell to it kinda like when some ppl add a small bells to a kitten to keep track of it. 

My hubby and I are recently homeless and ppl just act like we&#039;re the bottom of the bottom and I&#039;m talking about ppl in churches. They judge us all the time and they always tell us &quot;Well we used to help with food vouchers or motel vouchers but the govt stopped giving us the gift cards.&quot; Also they always make us fill out applications and give us a lecture bc after all they&#039;ve arrived. Then they forget that we&#039;re ppl too and we just lost our jobs and we&#039;ve got been thru so much even after careful planning and saving. We&#039;re living in our car and we&#039;ve had to eat a can a beans with a pack of tortillas =$3.00 

And whenever we go to a fast food place before we would usually do get extra napkins, cutlery, salt and pepper, etc. Like from Chik FIL A u can just go in at breakfast u can get free condiments including honey and jelly packs. 

Once we stayed inside a Bojangles talking to somebody while they are and we stayed from 7:00-10:00 p.m. we only drank a soda and we were the last ones in the place and the workers asked if we wanted what they were about to throw away and we said yes! They gave us lots of food to go! 

Also if u hang out at a hospital lobby to get out of the heat or whatever or u might want to just sit in one of their waiting rooms there is FREE coffee, free tea, free hot cocoa and u can even ask the chaplains office if u can have a meal ticket so u can eat from the cafeteria and just make up something like ur visiting someone there and if u know anybody who is in the hospital but can&#039;t afford the meds prescribed ask the chaplains office to help or even a church. 

Also a grocery store called Publix doesn&#039;t charge for some specific prescriptions. 

If u have ever needed an address use a friends address but put ur mail on hold for 30 days at a time so u can maintain an address. Go ahead and pick it up b4 ur 30 days are up and put it back on hold again for 30 days. 

Some libraries can issue u a library card if u use this address on hold. 

Talk to ppl and always be nice bc u will get free info and free stuff. Sometimes we go to free seminars for free food and free stuff and get on email lists for upcoming events. 

Some churches have outreaches with free haircuts and stuff. Keep up with free events around the city with the free newspaper too. 

Got more ideas to share and will come back to this website. I&#039;ve seen some ppl buy a small pack of hot dogs and buns and ask a gas station with a microwave to use to heat up food and reuse a cup to get free ice and water. 

If u go to a food pantry see if they have those powder drink mixes so u can use them at any time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was lucky enough to have a job that pays cash everyday with a bathroom outside. Tho my boss leaves it locked at night I am able to wash up during the day and sleep behind the building at night out of the cameras. My only issue now is the cold... It&#039;s in the low 30s right now and I&#039;m so scared of hypothermia.  Any suggestions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My husband and I have fallen on hard times and it wasnt sudden but happened over the last 4 years. In a few days we will be homeless. We dont know what to do with our belongings. So we are giving them away and selling what we can. We both are not in good health but not old enough for government help I guess. I am legally blind. And my Husband has diabetic ulcerations on his feet. Thats what lost him his job. And nobody wants to hire a blind lady. Anyway we have been researching how to live our of our truck. And to tell you the truth, its going to be a relief! No more worrying about the bills, the rent, etc. I just hope we can do it. And you have certainly given us hope! Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a woman, I pee in the woods or in a cup. Forget trying to guide it into a dang bottle! I use napkins &#038; I never throw them on the ground. I look for a trash &#038; dispose of them there. As far as poopin&#039; goes, we lived in a trailer &#038; unfortunately couldn&#039;t afford a campground to hook up water &#038; sewer to. So, we placed a plastic bag in the toilet bowl, sat down &#038; did our duty, err, doodie. all toilet wipes went in to that bag, tied it up &#038; threw it in the trash. It doesn&#039;t take a lot of brainpower to figure out how to take a crap. If you have no plastic bag, dig a dang hole &#038; then cover it over when you&#039;re done so nobody else accidently steps in it.]]></description>

So, we placed a plastic bag in the toilet bowl, sat down &amp; did our duty, err, doodie. all toilet wipes went in to that bag, tied it up &amp; threw it in the trash. It doesn&#8217;t take a lot of brainpower to figure out how to take a crap. If you have no plastic bag, dig a dang hole &amp; then cover it over when you&#8217;re done so nobody else accidently steps in it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Never thought homeless people cooked? Wow???!!! We&#039;re not all useless to ourselves. It takes nothing to make a fire. Find a pot or pan &#038; you can cook anything, plus provide warmth. Many of us DO actually cook. Great comment. That&#039;s all you could offer here?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing i learned from a survivalist was that you only need to boil the water for a few minutes to get clean drinking water. Not 20 or 30 or whatever others say. I would rather do this than add ANY amount of bleach. Bleach was created as a poison in the first place. If you&#039;re homeless, why create more problems? You can make a fire anywhere. Boil your water.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely agree w J and Hawklover,

Though think like anything it can depend on what work someone can find. No matter what, trying to secure some income should be a goal. Regardless of living accommodations trying to build up some cash reserves seems to me to be really important. So guess employment will dictate a persons schedule to great extent.

Have been homeless before for 1yr ... dead of winter midwest. Lucked out and found a commercial building that was pretty much abandoned and stayed there. Backdoor was already downed, though if I&#039;dve been caught nobody would&#039;ve believed I&#039;d found it that way, Ah ... guess could&#039;ve still tried for reasonable doubt or whatever.

Facing homelessness again. This time around decided to go with Hawklovers approach. Google maps, switch to satellite view and look for wooded areas. Worth noting any you come across while traveling too and think it&#039;s important to actually inspect these places on site. A satellite isn&#039;t going to tell someone actual conditions of the location(s), changes from time the images were taken etc so forth. A couple that looked good on satellite turned out to be golf courses ( country clubs.) That&#039;dve turned out great, having some retired dentist wanting to play through my camp. :)

Am still focused on work prospects and so choosing a site that within a reasonable distance of as many businesses as possible is an important consideration for me. A person walks on avg 3mi per hour, so for me figuring that gives me about a 3mi radius around the urban camp sites I&#039;ve evaluated. The public library here as a subscription to a bunch of databases, one of those is called reference USA and a person can search businesses by many criteria, one of them being by radius around a given address. Helped me zero in on businesses within walking distance to put in apps and see how many prospects are within x-radius of a camp site.

Personally do think it&#039;s a good idea to scout out more than one. If at all possible stash/cache some supplies. ( Clothing = get the stuff via local help agencies if necessary. Many will give a person down on their luck some vouchers. Some food stores, hopefully even a tent and some tarps whatever other supplies.) Someone could rotate them occasionally to break up routine. People may tend to notice a pattern of a person constantly coming going to the point they stick out. Coming and going via the same routes can also leave noticeable tracks. Such fallback sites gives someone ... someplace to fall back to if for whatever reason a preferred urban camp can&#039;t be used. Doesn&#039;t leave a person with all eggs in 1 basket.

Here and am sure in many other places seems to be plenty of patches of woods along railroad tracks, side of highways and just me but tended to look for those located within industrial or business zoned areas. Less residential buildings and hoping more employment prospects. Though have seen patches behind many businesses in this city that appear dense enough to work too. Kind of close to residences, so stands to reason more pedestrian traffic.

A tent might not be home but atm it&#039;s my option and beats sleeping on the ground behind a dumpster or nook+cranny I think anyway.  Thanks the author of this site, sucks that folks are going through this but makes people like myself feel a bit less lonely + depressed knowing I&#039;m not alone or the only one. Do feel it&#039;s a good thing to stay positive, whatever we&#039;re going through. Despair and depression are killers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been homeless for two days now.  I have a scooter and scouted the area for a place to sleep and came across a commercial building that was empty and for lease.  I went to the back and found a trash bin area that had three sides of brick and an unlocked gate in front.  One dumpster was there as it could hold three, but since there was only a dentist in the building, there was one.  This left plenty of room for me to wheel the scooter in, reposition the dumpster so that no one could see me, and I slept on the ground.  I used bug spray from the 99 cent store to keep the bugs away, found some cardboard and used two of my towels for padding.  It has worked great so far. I get there at 8:00 p.m., and sleep until 5:00 a.m.  This prevents me from being surprised by the trash truck or any of the people who work for the dentist.]]></description>

Add to that a very well off but very greedy family of my own who discarded me when I reached out. So here I am, dependent on some close friends whilst I rebuild my life. Broke and broken hearted, homeless and homosexual, bilingual and bipolar - what could possibly go wrong?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Petrol is harder to come by but diesel is easy! Most trucks don&#039;t have locks on the tanks. A friend of mine always kept a 44gal drum on the back of his 4x4 if he saw a truck parked away from houses it was fair game. Many truck drivers don&#039;t have room for their rigs at their suburban houses so they will park in an industrial area or near a common area near their homes. He would usually not take the whole lot and most of the time the truckie would have so much he wouldn&#039;t miss 15-20gal which would
 keep his 4x4 running for quite a while. The suction thing takes practice and he always kept mentors or gum in his glove compartment for his breath afterward. You have to create suction with your mouth while breathing through your nose. Practice with water. You can get a jiggle siphon if you want to avoid this but its hit and miss if they work. If theres not enough in the tank or your hose is too short its a no go. Have to have a diesel too. If your at risk of becoming homeless it might be something to consider acquiring before the H bomb hits.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where i am we have strict gun controls. If you have a gun/rifle yes even an air rifle or pellet gun it has to be locked up in a secure location listed on your gun licence. And even a slingshot is illegal unless it is dismantled. You can carry a yoke and band but not assembled. For the last year whilst homed i have acquired and been practicing every week with a bow. I started with a compound but this is both bulky and heavy. Then i switched to a take down recurve which has removable limbs. Fits easily into a rucksack or car. Assembles in minutes. Takes a while to master but the trade off in weight is phenomenal. And the arrows are reusable. So your not buying ammunition. Will take down more than a rat or bunny without a problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good idea for those that tent it in the woods like myself (but not in winter) is my idea ( maybe someone already thought of it) is to get 20-30 plastic milk crates only stack them one high and make a big square with them to place the tent onto just to keep from the cold permanating through to the sleeping individual in the tent.I have done this and it works also good to get off of ground when it rains. The milk crates are plentiful at gas stations.I also would suggest building a wood frame to connect tarps to a home made roof to further battle sun and heavy rain . I guess all this if a person is going to be out in a secluded spot in the woods for more than a couple months  alright thanx Im in Minnesota.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oilfield trash
Since my divorce, I find it interesting to go to new places and live off the fat of the land. Generally I just take a backpacking pack with hiking/camp equipment and live out of it. Guess I have an advantage as I do this for fun and not necessity. Having a vehicle is a real bonus to. Mostly for storing gear though. It&#039;s more interesting to stay out and about.  My work schedule is 28/14. &quot;More people should do this!&quot; When at work room and board are paid, when off my time is my own. I live practically footloose and fancy free. Not to mention all the interesting people met along the way. In urban areas If you stay in greenways off the beaten path, Most city people are afraid to venture there during the night. If you play an instrument you can usually hustle up enough money to eat on without ever breaking into your savings. Not to mention all the fishing and hunting you can do within U.S. cities (don&#039;t get caught). It&#039;s actually a rather nice lifestyle. Just watch your back. Not everyone out there has your best interest at heart .]]></description>

Art gallery opening receptions, lectures, college events, church events, conferences things like this you can really fill the stomach. Make an initial pass at the refreshment table. Chat with others. Make another pass. Chat with others. Then go to the next venue. Repeat.

I&#039;ve seen one other gentlemen on the event circuit who seems to be up to the same thing as me and we give each other a grin.

Also, I work as a television and movie extra on occasion. Craft services can really smooth out the rough edges. I follow my art gallery routine. Fill a plate. Walk away to chit chat. Then fill another plate. Granola bars go into my pocket for later.

I do soup kitchens (they often give a to-go bag) and food pantries.

		<description><![CDATA[P.S. I hear a question. Why not just pee at Tim Hortons? Well, if you&#039;ve ever driven across Canada with only one licensed driver in the vehicle, and no extra money for restaurants/motel rooms etc. Your choice is to drive as long as you can between campgrounds. Your driver may also have to pull over into one of the many rest areas along the way to sleep, and the next Tim Horton&#039;s might be hours, or even a day&#039;s drive away. These rest areas are very beautiful by day, but soooo dark at night, and you might be surrounded in acres of dense woods with owls, racoons, wolves, moose, skunks and bears. As a woman who is both a scaredy cat in the dark, and a total germophobe when it comes to the highly unrecommended public outhouses, I found the hose idea to be a life saver. Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A feminine way of peeing. I wish I could post a picture of the cheap shower hose you can buy (sometimes even at a dollar store) for a few dollars. It has a fairly long vinyl rubber hose, with a soft rubber cup at one end and a plastic shower head at the other. The soft rubber cup is designed to fit snuggly over a faucet. Pull off the plastic shower head, it will only complicate things. Carefully press the soft rubber cup over your urethra and allow a small stream to come out to check your positioning, if there are no drips then release the rest, there is no need to pee slowly. The convenience of this method is that you can pee standing up if you have to. Have water ready and immediately rinse through the hose, have baby wipes for yourself, and alcohol towelettes to clean the soft rubber cup. A friend of mine and I drove to and from Vancouver Island, Canada, in a van... made many stops at Tim Hortons all the way. I came up with this idea because I didn&#039;t want to have to get out and go behind the van and get caught in someones headlights, or get mauled by a bear or something. I was a pro at sitting on the edge of my seat and hanging the hose out the door, and the door only had to be open a few inches. The trick is rinsing the hose with water without spilling water! Anyways, it meant I could pee at night and feel safe, and it also meant that him and I could stand by a bush and pee together. :)]]></description>

Don&#039;t suck on a hose. You will get gasoline in your mouth and lungs and cause permanent damage.
If you steal gas you will likely get caught. However if you have 5 gallon can and a siphon hose on hand folks may allow you to take a can full from their tank if you ask.

This is a gravity flow system and the target can must be lower than the source. Put you finger over the end to stop it and then raise the hose above the source and remove it. This will prevent spills.]]></description>

As for female needs, as a retired military member who worked in the &quot;field&quot; with women, it brings on difficulties that most men (and women) would not understand (I was a field medic and Reg nurse, so I can at least relate a little).

		<description><![CDATA[When I was in this predicament I did not look homeless.  I didn&#039;t tell people either.  I was lucky to know someone who had a cement garage that locked from inside so I had shelter.  Albeit not super warm, it was much safer than sleeping on the streets.  During this time I would get up each day and walk to the closest hotel to where I stayed.  I would do a sponge bath in the bathroom and even washed my hair in the sink.  Afterwards, I used the hand dryer as a hair dryer to dry my hair.  I didn&#039;t make much of a mess and always made sure it was clean before I left.  In this way I was presentable and able to land a job.

There are usually places like shelters, YWCA&#039;s, and the like that hand out free toothbrushes, brushes and other hygiene items as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I grew up on trap lines in northern Canada.  I have cleaned many animals for both fur and food (as an adult i no longer aprove of killing for just fir! - this was before i was 12 years old so done blast me).  It takes some getting used to the taste of wild meat... it doesn&#039;t taste anything like your grocery store chicken/beef.  If you find the taste strong (wild) just add spices (lots of them) or overcooking tends to dull it a little.. I,ve also heard that soaking in mild water/vinagar also helps.  Either way, if your hungy enough you&#039;ll eat anything.  I have not tried squirrel but i hear its good... rabbit is wonderful if caught in the right place in the right time (they are what they eat so they do taste different in different parts of country).  As for pellet gun... most under 500 fps are a little tricky killing small rodents, but i have taken many a rabbit as a youth at close range with an eye shot (drops them quickly).  Body shots wont do it.  Try to get the pellet into the brain through the skull by way of the soft eye socket.  Sorry if i trouble anyone with this... just don&#039;t make the bunny suffer... its bad enough she has to die to feed you.  Good luck.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I grew up on trap lines in northern Canada.  I have cleaned many animals for both fur and food (as an adult i no longer aprove of killing for just fir! &#8211; this was before i was 12 years old so done blast me).  It takes some getting used to the taste of wild meat&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t taste anything like your grocery store chicken/beef.  If you find the taste strong (wild) just add spices (lots of them) or overcooking tends to dull it a little.. I,ve also heard that soaking in mild water/vinagar also helps.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m about to become homeless.  I was once this way at 15 for a few months... it was difficult then.  I know more now at 52 years old so i should fare a little better.  Its sort of a relief in some ways... not going to miss to pressures of time that a busy career, home, bills, can place on you.  Only have to last 3 1/2 years and i get a (paid for) government pension at 55 ($1000/mth), then old age security (Canada) at 65.  I should have enought to pay for a room and some food.  Can&#039;t work anymore (disabled from Military) but not disabled enough for pension, just enough to not work at anything i can find.  No problem... time to see the country, do things (that don&#039;t require cash), and just enjoy the sunrise.  Already scoped out shelters for free food in Toronto  :)   And i understand that my federal government and Royal Canadian Legion have just started programs to help Military Veterans that are homeless.  Thanks for all the good advice... post more please.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where did you adopt your Wolfdog from?

Your mention of him sliding on the wood floors is just what ours does. She&#039;s in that pre-teen stage where she doesn&#039;t have her full weight yet so that when she sits, there&#039;s not enough weight to hold her down all the way and with no traction, she slowly starts to slide back into a down position, it&#039;s quite cute.

For the hair, have you ever looked into a Furminator? We got a large breed long hair one for our Luna and it works wonders; in the shedding season it looks as if she was storing a whole cat in her coat ha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[pasta with egg-
 cook pasta (penne, spirals, whatever).
drain (dont rinse).  In oil or butter in a pan fry about 4 eggs per pound of pasta until the whites are cooked and the yolks are almost done. Sprinkle salt &#038; pepper (&#038; fines herbes) on the eggs. Combine them with the pasta, breaking up the eggs.  Done and delicious. You can throw in other things too- cheese, veggies (sautee in pan before eggs, then cook eggs with vegs), meat, whatever.

also pasta salad- you just mix pasta and any salad dressing and veggies- cukes, bell peppers,, etc, - grapes, almonds, cheese, hard-boiled egg, whatever you want and it&#039;ll fill you up and taste good.

sriracha hot sauce makes anything tatse better, like rice &#038; beans, though avocado adds to the proteins and fats necessary during lean eating.

great site dude- keep the faith!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sleep AT NIGHT!! If you ever have hope of finding a job...your interview will be in the DAYTIME,right? If you have any hope of looking as sharp as you can, then it&#039;s gonna be in the daytime! If you are gonna surf the internet at the library then they are open in the ....c&#039;mon say it! DAYTIME!
Now, where to sleep at NIGHT?? 
I&#039;ve never seen a large city park that don&#039;t have darker undisturbed areas at NIGHT! My favorite one have 2 all night convenience stores with bathrooms within 5 minutes walking time.
But LOOK for these sweet sleeping digs in the...DAYTIME! You need to be able to check out details like street lights, windows from where you might be seen? can you come and go without ppl seeing you? Cars headlights lighting you up?
Also, sit back during the day and think about where you are...WHERE do the cops NOT drive by at ...NIGHT? Are there trees, bushes? Maybe a park shelter?
My favorite are hiking trails, because everyone ELSE is afraid of them at NIGHT! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry if I am being blunt, but maybe you are scapegoating?
The internet is little more than a tool; you are responsible for what you do with it. And while it allows you to reach people who live anywhere in the world, that doesn&#039;t mean that relationships are any easier.

If anything, after successive failures, you gotta ask if it&#039;s not the internet that has failed, but maybe you? My advice is to improve yourself, and the more you do, the more virtuous people will be drawn to you. And virtuous people (as opposed to fake, hypocritical, soul-dead philosophical zombies), are really the only kind of people worth associating with on a personal level.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If anything, the slavery is to tradition. People voluntarily work several jobs to pay the rent for huge houses they don&#039;t need...solely because they don&#039;t know any better. They do not understand that it is perfectly okay to live within their means, and because of this ingrained bigotry, the society makes things difficult for those who don&#039;t have a &quot;proper&quot; address.

Here is a blog about things people don&#039;t really need (which includes a house): http://thingsyoudontneed.blogspot.com/2009/01/bed.html

It&#039;s simply taken for granted that a house is considered a basic necessity rather than a luxury.]]></description>

http://board.freedomainradio.com/blogs/freedomain/archive/2008/11/14/real-time-relationships-the-book.aspx

Aside from that, since human beings are more nurture than nature, it is essential to look inward at where your problems originated; that is what it means to be a self-improving guru.


Not sure what you mean by hookers and &quot;the one&quot; though. A prostitute is someone who&#039;s self-esteem is so broken that they are willing to do what should be an intimate act for money.
Maybe what you need is to take a break from relationships altogether, and stop finding rebound girls (sorry for being so blunt). After every failed relationship, it is tempting to immediately find another, but important to step back and learn lessons from the experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not really.
Communism is usually enforced by a violence-based agency that holds itself above reproach (like the one that rules America).
Often when people propose a false dichotomy, there is a third option that is better than both proposed options. If people choose to live in a communist society, more power to them. But it is wrong to have that imposed on them by people who consider themselves exempt from common morality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is easy to blame capitalism and the free market for societal ills. But what many forget is that government interference is all pervading; we have never, ever had a truly free market. Free exchange (absent top-down imposition of the rulers will) is the most effective possible means of allocating resources and creating new technologies.
(in fact, many people forget that a &quot;corporation&quot; is a legal status created by the government, specifically intended to protect rich elites from consequences)

If you are interested, www.freedomainradio.com has a lot on this. A theory is that since a truly free market has yet to exist, it will not look like the society we live in now.
Aside from that, I greatly appreciate your advice; I plan on going homeless soon, and you have helped me be that much more prepared.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where i am we have strict gun controls. If you have a gun/rifle yes even an air rifle or pellet gun it has to be locked up in a secure location listed on your gun licence. And even a slingshot is illegal unless it is dismantled. You can carry a yoke and band but not assembled. For the last year whilst homed i have acquired and been practicing every week with a bow. I started with a compound but this is both bulky and heavy. Then i switched to a take down recurve which has removable limbs. Fits easily into a rucksack or car. Assembles in minutes. Takes a while to master but the trade off in weight is phenomenal. And the arrows are reusable. So your not buying ammunition. Will take down more than a rat or bunny without a problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I grew up on trap lines in northern Canada.  I have cleaned many animals for both fur and food (as an adult i no longer aprove of killing for just fir! - this was before i was 12 years old so done blast me).  It takes some getting used to the taste of wild meat... it doesn&#039;t taste anything like your grocery store chicken/beef.  If you find the taste strong (wild) just add spices (lots of them) or overcooking tends to dull it a little.. I,ve also heard that soaking in mild water/vinagar also helps.  Either way, if your hungy enough you&#039;ll eat anything.  I have not tried squirrel but i hear its good... rabbit is wonderful if caught in the right place in the right time (they are what they eat so they do taste different in different parts of country).  As for pellet gun... most under 500 fps are a little tricky killing small rodents, but i have taken many a rabbit as a youth at close range with an eye shot (drops them quickly).  Body shots wont do it.  Try to get the pellet into the brain through the skull by way of the soft eye socket.  Sorry if i trouble anyone with this... just don&#039;t make the bunny suffer... its bad enough she has to die to feed you.  Good luck.]]></description>

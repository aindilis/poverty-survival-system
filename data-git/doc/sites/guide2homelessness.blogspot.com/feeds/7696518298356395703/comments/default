Some of the articles make me tear up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My situation is a psychological one. I&amp;#39;m unmotivated, lazy, and i take everything in my life for granted. I want to find purpose in my life, and I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out how. I don&amp;#39;t want to be an average Joe, working a 9-5. I want to be free.

We camped in the woods in a tent most of the time.but we&amp;#39;ve slept under bridges,behind dumpster,etc I am a carpenter by trade and always tried to stay near a lower or home depot. I could stand outside with my hand tools and could usually find work with a contractor or home owner taking on a project. I would always scout out a stand of trees in which we could &amp;quot;disappear&amp;quot;. This isn&amp;#39;t always easy but if you keep your eyes open and know what to look for it can be done. Obviously you don&amp;#39;t need a real big stand of trees in warmer weather because of the foliage. Always pay attention to posted land as setting up camp there will usually bring trouble.it seemed if i scoped out an area for a while i could eventually find a suitable place to set up a long term campsite.(1-3months usually). If you are setting up a tent make sure you are either higher or lower than any roads around you as to not be seen.always try to enter the wooded area where as few people might see you do so. If at all possible try to enter into the wooded area from as many different points as possible. This will help a couple different things 1: if there&amp;#39;s any stores around people working there won&amp;#39;t see you coming and going in and out of the same point all the time.2: if you use the same route all the time you will make a path that someone else could follow to your camp. If you can find a good spot to set up a long term camp.here&amp;#39;s a couple of things i learned the hard way.try to find something you can store fresh water in .the bigger the better. ( an old cooler,a few 5 gallon buckets,etc...) you don&amp;#39;t have to fill these larger containers. Just get them back to your camp. Whenever you venture out from your camp,take along some sort of container to bring back water in(half gallon to a gallon at a time) after a little while you will gather more than enough fresh water for drinking,washing up, wash some clothes,etc...another thing whenever i would go out i would take a small plastic bag of garbage to throw away. If your staying in a wooded area no matter how big of a wooded area,garbage will attract animals.anything from a dog,racoon,skunk,rats,mice,reaches,etc... plus its just nasty having a bunch of garbage around your camp. After all this is your home for now. However long. Never leave open food in your tent unattended,chances are your tent will be shredded when you get back. There have been very few places where i could have a small fire either day or night.If you plan on staying at your camp for any length of time. You have to avoid bringing any attention by Anyone!!!.And don&amp;#39;t tell anyone where your camp is,even people who seem like they want to be helpful. The best camp i ever had i stayed at for almost five months. I had a tent, some old lawn chairs i found in a dumpster,a lifeline,a cooler,and plenty of fresh water i was able to have a trap over most of my camp. And always stayed dry in the rain. I never dared to have a fire for fear of being discovered. But both my wife and i were quite comfortable there.just because we were homeless didn&amp;#39;t mean we had to be uncomfortable. If you want to set up a camp in the woods for however long.. here are some things you will want to have....A tent (luxury) sleeping bag,sleeping pad or blankets.a knife,flashlight,a mirror,a watch , matches or lighter,bug spray(luxury).toilet paper,transistor radio(luxury) first aid supplies( band aids,disinfectant,etc...) an led lantern(luxury). Garage bags ( can be  used in a variety of ways). Good luck and happy camping</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/7696518298356395703/comments/default/6456480786042223150'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/7696518298356395703/comments/default/6456480786042223150'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/04/how-to-solve-homelessness.html?showComment=1390097399592#c6456480786042223150' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/04/how-to-solve-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7696518298356395703' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/7696518298356395703' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-784758400"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="6:09 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3557611612000987985</id><published>2013-08-05T05:57:20.982-07:00</published><updated>2013-08-05T05:57:20.982-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I appreciate the honesty and candor in which you t...</title><content type='html'>I appreciate the honesty and candor in which you tell the story of homelessness. Yet, today there is a whole new aspect to it and it&amp;#39;s the single woman without friend and family resources. There are fewer shelters for woman than men. Women are the silent homeless if not for safety reasons day and night. I don&amp;#39;t choose homelessness but if I lose my car, I lose my job and I lose my ability to pay for shelter. Unlike 2007, the resources are dry, people have ignored that many are still on the verge of losing it all. Do you have any suggestions for women staring down the barrel of this predicament? I have read bill paying sites and see so many homeless single moms and women. Abuse shelters only take you if you are abused. Homelessness use to be predominately male because of &amp;quot;family&amp;quot;. In this age of broken families and female independence in life and jobs comes the same predicament with little resources and much more danger. Never thought I would be in this predicament but if I can&amp;#39;t make this payment I will lose my car, my way to work and my means to provide shelter. Any ideas would help. You are very resourceful and have a sound goodness in your look at life, people and predicaments. Thank you for this blog. This needs to be a book. It needs to be sent to every politician. But it has to be updated to include the single females and single mothers facing this in this economy. Thanks for any ideas on how I can survive this.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/7696518298356395703/comments/default/3557611612000987985'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/7696518298356395703/comments/default/3557611612000987985'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/04/how-to-solve-homelessness.html?showComment=1375707440982#c3557611612000987985' title=''/><author><name>cindiw</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/04/how-to-solve-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7696518298356395703' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/7696518298356395703' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-2070224886"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:57 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8242719796679227427</id><published>2013-07-17T16:03:14.139-07:00</published><updated>2013-07-17T16:03:14.139-07:00</updated><title type='text'>So well put.

The things you say would help are things we really need as a society to solve a lot of problems that aren&amp;#39;t just not having a &amp;#39;home&amp;#39;.  Today i find this blog as someone who has made 6 figures, still make way above what would even qualify for low income housing (I checked) my credit is really trashed, in large part from helping family, I&amp;#39;ve kept at least 3 from being homeless by offering more than a couch, they didn&amp;#39;t help back but my helping them was about who I am not who they are.  I was just denied an apartment, I have a wife and 10 year old son and I&amp;#39;m reading this site because we are being forced out of our home in a place that has nearly nothing even for people with good credit and just as I have been since I left home at 18 years and 12 seconds :) i&amp;#39;ve been afraid of being homeless, solving all the problems you&amp;#39;ve figured out, I&amp;#39;ve studied it for 20  years always figuring its better to know what to do than just deal with it when it happens.  but the pods, the showers, the bathrooms, good god we need these things as a decent society, just as an example we took a 3 week vacation, our only destination was &amp;#39;south&amp;#39; just drove, found places when we felt like stopping, we must have dropped 12 grand on that trip, it was great, but a couple times, places were booked, we got lost, delayed, altitude sickness etc... we found a safe parking spot just like you talk about and slept in the car, we were ok with that, we knew that was a chance we&amp;#39;d have to take to be free and spontanious, but damn a pod and a shower? a clean bathroom without having to buy something? how is that not just basic humanity, should not matter if you dont have a place of your own or you have 12.  like really wtf does dick cheney do when he sharts his suit in a limo, they dont have bathrooms or showers, wouldn&amp;#39;t it just be utterly decent to have common public places to get your dignity back? and as for people &amp;#39;helping&amp;#39; totally, wtf? want to help someone? start by talking to them, hell my massive stress is lightened when a stranger gives me the decency of just opening up a conversation. we need to learn how to be human again, we all have problems and homelessness is a symptom of a problem, it isn&amp;#39;t the problem. and for people that don&amp;#39;t get that, are aboriginal people homeless? chew on that a bit for some perspective.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/7696518298356395703/comments/default/8242719796679227427'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/7696518298356395703/comments/default/8242719796679227427'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/04/how-to-solve-homelessness.html?showComment=1374102194139#c8242719796679227427' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/04/how-to-solve-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7696518298356395703' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/7696518298356395703' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-535359399"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:03 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4015207197428440573</id><published>2013-07-10T13:19:58.161-07:00</published><updated>2013-07-10T13:19:58.161-07:00</updated><title type='text'>19 years old listening to The Boxer..1969 simon an...</title><content type='html'>19 years old listening to The Boxer..1969 simon and Garfunkel.. reading your Blog..tearing up as im Contemplating Catching a Rail Road track and leaving behind a Mother,Father and 5 siblings.. my reasons..

I recently became homeless like yesterday.  I just thought you could go to a homeless shelter and you would be just fine, umm no.  The lady doing intake asked if I took any meds which I should but trying to keep in my home I quit taking them to have more money.  She told me I couldn&amp;#39;t stay there unless I took my meds that I could go to the er to get my meds.  After hours of waiting and being treated like a pill seeker all they did was write me a rx and send me on my way doesn&amp;#39;t do me any good don&amp;#39;t have the money to fill it.  The shelter said that wouldn&amp;#39;t do the er was supposed to physically give me enough meds until their clinic opens on Thursday 2 days away so I couldn&amp;#39;t stay.  Thank god I have a car and my kids are staying at their dads, but dammit it was 17 last night, illegal to &amp;quot;camp&amp;quot; in my town. And I am freaking scared to death.

Homelessness effects a person mentally and emotionally. You never really get over it. It lingers. Even now, as I am not homeless it is with me. Every time I drive through downtown and see large numbers of homeless people (who I see as kindred spirits). But, you can never really share this with someone and expect them to understand. Homeless people see both faces of society and the very blatant hypocritical face. The callousness of people, though there are kind souls out there, and the overall disdain with which we are treated. We are looked down upon and seen as lazy. I used to shower at the local college, dumpster dive at Mcdonald&amp;#39;s after closing (they stopped the practice of tossing out leftover food ages ago), but most importantly tried to avoid those areas that were dangers to homeless people. It is hard and it toughens you up.

I am homeless, and have been for 13 yrs. At first it was by choice, then later, I was severely abused and ended up on the street again, after I had gotten my life together.  I ended up hopping freights and hitchhiking over the USA.  I agree with your suggestions- the whole anti-sleep brigade (I have encountered this the worst in NYC, where I got one day of sleep in a week if I was lucky-and innovative enough) is horrible.. the public will never understand, and being peed on in my sleep because I don&amp;#39;t have a bed doesn&amp;#39;t make want to &amp;quot;get a job&amp;quot;- it only makes me more determined to survive and be self-sufficient (such as run my own business online, etc.)  I&amp;#39;m 31 now, and live in an RV, but I am still considered &amp;quot;homeless&amp;quot;, and still need the same help I did before- food, clothing, showers (if I can&amp;#39;t afford a campground, etc) .. and ESPECIALLY a public restroom.  In NY I was literally hospitalized because I held in my excrement so long that I got sick. This is what people want- us to die, to be invisible, to get our filthy butts off of the street.  I was one of the dirty crusty kids for awhile, but now I agree with your idea that you should dress nicer when homeless- I did that for years in the beginning, and no one ever knew- cops even asked me what I was doing hanging with the people I was sitting with!  lol.  Now I&amp;#39;m definitely cleaner, but still the same person I&amp;#39;ve always been- just smarter on the streets.  And angrier.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/7696518298356395703/comments/default/9174643276766032571'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/7696518298356395703/comments/default/9174643276766032571'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/04/how-to-solve-homelessness.html?showComment=1332592400166#c9174643276766032571' title=''/><author><name>Texas Meg</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/04/how-to-solve-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7696518298356395703' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/7696518298356395703' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-728573835"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:33 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2710180661175165418</id><published>2012-03-19T21:12:49.045-07:00</published><updated>2012-03-19T21:12:49.045-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I am contimplating running away, and I think that ...</title><content type='html'>I am contimplating running away, and I think that what the last few paragraphs are very true.

I have been actively job searching for 2 years now with no luck and the town i&amp;#39;m living in has little to no job opportunitys. Im poor and have only a bicycle as transportation. If i made the &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot; to be homeless(preferably temporarly) i could relocate to a town with more job opportunitys,get out of the un-sanitary conditions and no longer have to withstand being treated poorly. However i really have a significant lack of how to thrive homeless and would want to avoid jail....any advice appreciated.

The urge to do so by dictating and controlling in order to &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; (the only way to actively change someone&amp;#39;s life against their will) is what led to Maoist China and Stalin&amp;#39;s Russia.  You seem to be following the thinking Mobile was describing of treating homelessness like a sickness.  That&amp;#39;s just another form of rejection and prejudice. You&amp;#39;re right that economic justice is important, though, it would probably make surviving homeless easier. However as long as the prejudice against homelessness remains, it will probably always be harder to be homeless than it has to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It&amp;#39;s unfortunate that homelessness isn&amp;#39;t respected as much as mountain climbing.

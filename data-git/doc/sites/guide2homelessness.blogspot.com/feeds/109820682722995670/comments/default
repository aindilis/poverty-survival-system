I&amp;#39;m a 44 year old woman and I will be homeless at the end of the year.  I am employed but lost a high paying career about 2 years ago when the economy took a hit.  I was downsize out of my cushy lifestyle.  So now i&amp;#39;m making about half of what I was and struggle every day financially.  I do have a car so I will be using that as &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;.  While it is scary to think about not having a roof over my head at night.  I feel like I have time to get prepared and take care of the details of this life change.

Currently I have a &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;, just one that I am not comfortable being in most of the time so about half of my nights I voluntarily sleep in my car, 1/4 at home, 1/8 at friends houses but only as hangouts and never as handouts, and the other 1/8th I just don&amp;#39;t sleep. So far so good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently quit my job to save my sanity, but sane sources of income are getting harder to come by these days. I&amp;#39;ve begun to live a very minimalistic lifestyle and have been giving serious thought to becoming a nomad because I feel my heart would be happier.&lt;br /&gt;But I do fear that this might come upon me much sooner than expected and sooner than I am able to prepare for.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m so happy I came across this blog, I feel so much more informed. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also, I&amp;#39;m wondering if you&amp;#39;ve ran into many homeless women in your experience and maybe noted any of their wisdom?&lt;br /&gt;I grew up in a house full of men and I&amp;#39;ve never been able to succumb to the &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re a woman let people take care of you&amp;quot; idea. I just think of it as I&amp;#39;m a woman so I have to keep a sharper eye and use my intuition to read people while still being prepared for the worst.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/1674662569365682935'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/1674662569365682935'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html?showComment=1405675546169#c1674662569365682935' title=''/><author><name>Stephanie Genna</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11813240706541167593</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109820682722995670' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109820682722995670' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-663193210"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="2:25 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4118618553713033060</id><published>2014-04-14T11:42:09.290-07:00</published><updated>2014-04-14T11:42:09.290-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Your blog is amazing and I find your comments to b...</title><content type='html'>Your blog is amazing and I find your comments to be very profound.

I&amp;#39;m thinking of using a storage unit for a roof over my head at night.  I plan to shower at the gym and then work my full time and also a part time job.  I really just pay rent right now for a place to be about 6 hours a day anyway.  It seem like such a waste.

I would sew Velcro into my new looking shirts(which would hopefully stay new looking since I may rarely wash them) and every day take out the pad and replace it, and wash the old one and put it in a mesh part of the backpack or whatever to dry. There is already such a solution for panty liners that you sew that you can Google, but no reusable underarm solution.. I am in addition to that, practicing how to take a spray bottle shower in 32 oz of water(hair washing included-you just wash the roots with a small sponge and a TINY bit of soap and it works good!).

I bought a used mini van from a homeless outreach health center, then removed the back seats. Then I bought a good single mattress and a tent made almost entirely of mosquito net and put it inside the van on top of the mattress. My bedding and anything else I didn&amp;#39;t want the bugs to get into then went inside the tent with me every night, including my backpack and walking shorts. I was sure to drink at least one bottle of orange juice or water a day, and to save the bottles to pee in at night. I had a 24 Hour Fitness gym membership and used the equipment there to stay fit, and the showers and toilet. I just took my full pee bottles in my backpack in with me to the gym in the morning and emptied them in the toilet and threw the bottles in the trash can. I used the local laundromat for cleaning my clothes, and just stacked clean clothes in the van next to the tent. I bought those dark plastic rain guards for the front windows so I could keep them open an inch or two at night, and my rear windows were the push-out kind which I also opened at night to get air flow. The full-net tent on top of a mattress worked like a charm and allowed air flow with the van windows.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/7435474608924434073'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/7435474608924434073'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html?showComment=1362372691232#c7435474608924434073' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109820682722995670' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109820682722995670' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1139575767"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:51 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2918790605181475128</id><published>2012-12-28T21:40:49.385-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-28T21:40:49.385-08:00</updated><title type='text'>This is modern day cave painting.

way i never thought i would have to. i guess its true. it can happen to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;much like the author, i went to college, even graduated cum laude last may. but, despite all my efforts and those of my relatives, i can&amp;#39;t find a job. oddly enough though, I&amp;#39;m being blamed by my relatives for people deciding i am either over-qualified or under-qualified, and refusing to hire me on either basis. every relationship between my family members is fractured to the breaking point and the fissures are growing everyday.  i feel like my welcome is rapidly being worn out, and things will come to a head soon. so its best to prepare for what, to me, is the worst-case scenario.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all i can say is thank you for this guide.  the knowledge will hopefully keep me, and others like me from having to learn it first hand and probably save some time in jail due to ignorance and stupidity.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml'

make of this. I ask a question on Google about homelessness and this is what I find. It&amp;#39;s Interesting and Insightful. I guess that this feels like a real eye opener for me. I am currently on the verge of being homeless. I knew it was a possibillity but didn&amp;#39;t think it would happen to me. Being Homeless seems intense! And I&amp;#39;m scared, but I know it&amp;#39;s coming very soon. So, thanks for this information:) I do have a question though, I am a young, attractive (not being vain, just the truth:/) female in my early twenties, is it more dangerous for a woman to be homeless?(I&amp;#39;m assuming it is...if yes, what are some survival tools for a female on the street?)??? And Where I live there are not a lot of resources for homeless ppl. I&amp;#39;ve searched online for shelters in my area and I have been homeless when I was a child so I know the shelter in my town is not safe at all!And we do Not have transit in my town and I cannot afford a cab. I find myself currently unemployed, without a car and I cannot crash anywhere anymore. Family is out of the question and my social life is sh** And I&amp;#39;m broke!:( bumming, slumming, and using my friends laptop! Any advice on what I should do?I can work, I have documentation, but no vehicle and hitch hiking is illegal and like I said i&amp;#39;m a young female, I don&amp;#39;t want to take that risk. Homelessness is near I can taste it almost...I just want to be prepared, I know It will take a while to get back on my feet,but I just want to be ready. Thanks:)</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/7103800772629849014'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/7103800772629849014'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html?showComment=1342193504467#c7103800772629849014' title=''/><author><name>Lindo.</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/17777816189710554763</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109820682722995670' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109820682722995670' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-373609144"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:31 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4945994175309435211</id><published>2012-06-18T15:13:55.159-07:00</published><updated>2012-06-18T15:13:55.159-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Thank You.</title><content type='html'>Thank You.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/4945994175309435211'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/4945994175309435211'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html?showComment=1340057635159#c4945994175309435211' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109820682722995670' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109820682722995670' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-156820895"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="3:13 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7734258550273300029</id><published>2012-06-10T06:27:42.725-07:00</published><updated>2012-06-10T06:27:42.725-07:00</updated><title type='text'>The truth of the matter is that in today&amp;#39;s Ame...</title><content type='html'>The truth of the matter is that in today&amp;#39;s America almost all of us are closer to being homeless than we are to being wealthy.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/7734258550273300029'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/7734258550273300029'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html?showComment=1339334862725#c7734258550273300029' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109820682722995670' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109820682722995670' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-453093749"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="6:27 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2196956680927238959</id><published>2012-03-27T16:59:24.572-07:00</published><updated>2012-03-27T16:59:24.572-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I care about you, D. &#xa;&#xa;Homelessness is not a measu...</title><content type='html'>I care about you, D. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homelessness is not a measure of your worth.

It sucks. IN the beginning my feet would swell up constantly hasn&amp;#39;t happened in few months.  This blogs hit the points spot on. I sleep in my back seat. I have long hair so i braid it in before i climb in the back seat. I park in the cusp of residental and street parking. most nights i sleep Maybe 3 hrs tops. In southern CA it does get hot after 10am. I do feel hopeless, depressed and don&amp;#39;t even know where to begin.  Have GI bill to go to school but i totally feel absolutely lost. nowhere to go. all alone. i&amp;#39;ve lostin touch with friends. unemployment and no money limits outreach plus i feel too ashamed to speak to them regarding my plight. I spend my days in Starbucks (laptop), local library which opens at 10am or in Barnes and Noble. I am aimlessly living. I loathe it. I shower in the a motel once every 20 days or so. Other days i use BABY WIPES. still sucks but i have done it on deployments. i quickly shave legs, armpits and brush in starbucks private restrooms. feels like basic training (bootcamp) speed but i am desperate. It gets extremely loney. At night i find myself speaking to myself about things. i always thought that it  was the path to losing sanity. there are many days i cry myself to sleep sick of life. it&amp;#39;s not constructive and I eat cheap 99cents fast food once a day. Overall i do blend in but i avoid people contact afraid i have nothing useful to contribute. I am conflicted in my faith in the lord and i know i have to do somthing to turn my life around but just don&amp;#39;t know where to turn to. Sometimes i find myself regretting for not re enlisting othertimes i am glad i didn&amp;#39;t. on the bright side i have lost weight 25 lbs. This experience hasn&amp;#39;t change me in anyway other than my self esteem, self worth and confidence.&lt;br /&gt;i hope i get something in me to change my life around and be useful. I cannot expect anything from anyone but me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feeling beyond hopeless. &lt;br /&gt;D</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/7749595654778139667'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/7749595654778139667'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html?showComment=1332886873952#c7749595654778139667' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109820682722995670' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109820682722995670' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-762078142"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="3:21 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4242057472208901125</id><published>2012-02-27T00:16:47.705-08:00</published><updated>2012-02-27T00:16:47.705-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I too thought about writing a book due to my exper...</title><content type='html'>I too thought about writing a book due to my experiences. however I lack the motivation and software... haha... I had a great job but my job was located in one of the most expensive counties in the nation. even though I was making descent money I couldn&amp;#39;t afford to make rent and my truck payment... so I lived in my truck... Easy right... Wrong... you learn sooooo much... my first attempts were to stay at a state beach camp site... yeah it was great at 30$ a night. and a dollar per 3 minute shower tokens... yeah that sh*t got expensive... so I thought I would try staying in a church parking lot... well got a love those RELIGIOUS good people they called the cops to remove me... But not only did the cops bang on my camper shell they also called in reinforcements to search my vehicle and perform a full cavity search... I was late for work that day... to witch their reply was it is illegal to sleep in your car and that&amp;#39;s what hotels are for... at 75 dollars a night sure I&amp;#39;ll take 3...  well.. I don&amp;#39;t want to go on and on so I will just share some things I learned...  Lesson #1 You are not alone The more places you stay the more you see the same people (rest stops are great as long as you only go there when your ready to sleep and you do not use drugs... police will f*ck with you if you have ANY drugs including alcoholic beverages) I LIKE BEER.. haha... Lesson #2 find a gas station that has a floor drain and buy a dog sprayer that attaches to a faucet. make sure you buy a lot of stuff at that gas station and clean up after yourself. great way to have a hot shower... Lesson #3 be anonymous as possible... attracting attention to any one is only going to cause hard ship.. stay away from tweekers and don&amp;#39;t even look at police they will bash your face into a car for no reason and claim some bull sh*t story.. I speak from personal experience.  I could go on and on in this subject but I wont thanks for reading... safe journeys...

Every politician and law enforcement official should spend a day in the life of a homeless person. This site has opened my eyes. I have never even been close to being homeless but a couple times I&amp;#39;ve had to wait 6 or 7 hours overnight to get Greyhound bus connections after the station had closed. As a young female I had to wander around dangerous, unfamiliar cities for hours at night looking for a warm place to stay while waiting for my bus connection. It was a scary experience since I really felt a sense of having nowhere to go. I had to be resourceful and walked until I found all night cafes or bars where I could stay until the bus station re-opened. At least I had money in my pocket to do these things, but imagine if I had none?

I saved $405 because AutoZone had the parts needed for only $75 and with a Haynes Auto Manual for my truck, the work was done.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/9104705866886224766'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/9104705866886224766'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html?showComment=1319411825160#c9104705866886224766' title=''/><author><name>Charlotte</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08983871548225807191</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='21' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tdBMIX1uES4/TWHj3m3bo5I/AAAAAAAAACo/P9XPzSkV3fA/s220/Tim%2Band%2BDusty.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109820682722995670' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109820682722995670' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-269875694"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:17 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-9221883047417893377</id><published>2011-10-04T20:07:07.402-07:00</published><updated>2011-10-04T20:07:07.402-07:00</updated><title type='text'>To Mobile Homemaker,&#xa;Thank you for this blog and y...</title><content type='html'>To Mobile Homemaker,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this blog and your advice regarding the address for the job application.&lt;br /&gt;The idea of living in my car was very scary but reading your blog and advices from you and others helping me to survive until now living in diginity in my car as a woman. &lt;br /&gt;I do not speak to anybody about my situation and I do not join the crowds of the others which is an excellant advice to women inorder to survive during the homelessness.&lt;br /&gt;Now the weather in Seattle is getting cold so I try to wear double thick layers during the night and cross my fingers before I go to sleep to walk up safe next day.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/9221883047417893377'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/9221883047417893377'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html?showComment=1317784027402#c9221883047417893377' title=''/><author><name>RainWithHope</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109820682722995670' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109820682722995670' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1176848312"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:07 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-5287869452986083449</id><published>2011-10-01T10:13:25.973-07:00</published><updated>2011-10-01T10:13:25.973-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Outstanding info.

There are so few resources when one is newly homeless that it seems like you are the only one homelessness ever happened to.  I lost my house a few years back and my kids and I couch-hopped for three months.  Keeping up appearances while they were in school, trying to keep the family together, trying not to lose my mind, scrambling to find some way and somewhere to live--it nearly broke me.  Thankfully, family finally took us in and we are thriving now.  I long to have the security of living on my own terms, somewhere in-between homeless and the debt-ride of the American Dream.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/2267909089079387669'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109820682722995670/comments/default/2267909089079387669'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html?showComment=1312484896866#c2267909089079387669' title=''/><author><name>Anna</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109820682722995670' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109820682722995670' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-138711894"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="12:08 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-639772039017266638</id><published>2011-07-04T12:04:08.657-07:00</published><updated>2011-07-04T12:04:08.657-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Excellent blog and very interesting.

They had limited beds and made sure to let everyone know if they didn&amp;#39;t behave there bed could be taken. Then the rules and curfew. I am not a child I am a grown women. I will not be told when I can sleep, when I can use the toilet, and when to shower. I felt like I was under control of people who let the power get to there head. They turned it into abuse in my opinion. Making us all feel like we were less then them.

I lost my housing. I have 4 kids one still a minor in school. My only income is the veterans disability I get now, it is a little over $200 a month, I have been eligible to get it for 30 years but I never needed it and wanted those who did need it to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a minor child who is living at my mom&amp;#39;s house, I can not stay there by her request, though she does help me as she can besides giving my youngest a home. My oldest lives 90 miles away in the country and the 6 weeks I stayed with him about drove me insane, no jobs at all and I could not referee their contentious  marriage any longer. My next oldest lives in town and I stayed 2 weeks until his wife found out I was not getting food stamps so that was that. My next to last son is living at friends in whatever amounts of days he can and he has stayed with me as well, so I guess you would say he and I are both homeless together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am lucky enough to have a car, but I also have slept in the shelter, once was enough, yes lice scabies, illness, theft and violence. There are good things about the shelter here at least. You can park and car sleep all you want no fuss no muss and no cops. They will let you in 24 hours a day to pee which as a female (no peeing in a jar for me) is awesome. Shower access, tv and computers when you need them and I can get 2-3 meals a day for nothing but being frisked when I enter, no one trying to force feed me Christianity.&lt;br /&gt; Since I am also a vet and it allows me to network with other homeless vets and find out what is new for a vet (the VA has some homeless services for us, they do clothing drives and we get first pick before they donate the rest type things, medical care etc) and the guys will always help me if I need it. Come wake me and see if I want breakfast and if I don&amp;#39;t half the time they bring me food later. So these are some of the good things about a shelter, but for the most part they are 16 hours (unless you have a job, here they will hold your bed until you get off plus one hour travel time but you must bring a note from your employer everyday, total fun hey boss can I have a note for the homeless shelter I live in?) of do as you are told or hit the streets. Do not kid yourself a worker will put you out in a second if they don&amp;#39;t like you for any reason. The one here is a for profit and they make tons of money even if they are not full they get millions in fees AND donations. The only good thing is that if they have no beds you can sleep in the TV room in a plastic chair, sleeping on the floor gets you put out and hope that a bed becomes available. The one church run one we have is for men only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I did not have the other vets it would be very scary, they are housing a lot of the mentally ill, it is a wet shelter meaning you can be drunk or high and not be turned away and people from the homeless camps come in a few days a month for showers and they have a definite hierarchy you want to avoid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a shelter is humiliating and depressing and enough days of that and you are no good to yourself or anyone else. Joblessness and homelessness if involuntary (it sounds like you choose this life and have the resources to change it if you want too) sucks completely. I should be working, housed, enjoying my last child&amp;#39;s senior year in high school and cooking holiday meals for my 6 grandkids. This was not the way I dreamed my life would be as a girl or as a soldier protecting our country, unfortunately life is what it is and not what we would want and in this country now we are all about money and all other values take a back seat.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/3373391659891956646'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/3373391659891956646'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html?showComment=1389383254808#c3373391659891956646' title=''/><author><name>Monika Carpenter</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05316849865225099739</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109915381192378495' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109915381192378495' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-608933216"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="11:47 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6366900977195980227</id><published>2013-12-02T15:55:02.182-08:00</published><updated>2013-12-02T15:55:02.182-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I refuse to do shelters because you can&amp;#39;t pay ...</title><content type='html'>I refuse to do shelters because you can&amp;#39;t pay me to sleep in a bed full of lice, fleas, scabies, bed bugs.

Or even ONE answer, an answer to alternative hostels ...&lt;br /&gt;I would love to help but I feel threatened by people on the streets - because of drink problems, drug problems, professional begging or even the ungrateful attitude that I feel I am reading here that &amp;#39;what you are offering is not helpful&amp;#39; &amp;#39;you are judgmental&amp;#39; I think we are all judgmental when we look from our lives into the lives of others and compare them to our own, but acting disrespectfully in reaction to our judgement is a different matter and at least we are looking into the lives of others and trying to think of a way to help.&lt;br /&gt;What do I do? I give food, generally, I often go and buy fresh food from the nearby supermarket and then give it to the three or four people sitting on the roadside, different ones each time but almost always someone there.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to provide a sleeping and sanitation facility sometime in the future. My vision has been similar to the capsule hotels ... I saw a picture of a disused set of about 5 public toilets that were being used as places for people to sleep - it occurred to me then that a small room with a bed could be provided in the same way as coin-operated public toilets. A line of coin-operated washrooms, a line of coin-operated bedrooms, and the cleaning paid for using the coins collected. However this wouldn&amp;#39;t enable people to leave any items securely during the day, and there would be some form of time restriction - otherwise how would one days&amp;#39; rent end and another begin? How would there be a time to keep the facilities clean and safe? So I would hope to have a row of lockers as well. &lt;br /&gt;I realise this is overly simplistic and optimistic - of course it is, because I am on the outside of this lifestyle looking in and I have no direct experience. However I would be interested in hearing your view on this type of facility.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/8981336224941626776'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/8981336224941626776'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html?showComment=1369847805748#c8981336224941626776' title=''/><author><name>Squirrel</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03035421557422244710</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109915381192378495' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109915381192378495' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-268648431"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:16 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6344498994560048706</id><published>2013-05-28T16:11:21.019-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-28T16:11:21.019-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I have also experienced this one night and I agree...</title><content type='html'>I have also experienced this one night and I agree, it is excruciating.

Thank you for this blog, although I would encourage you to do some research specific to women threatened by homelessness, for there are issues we face that men do not in the same situation. Unfortunately, for the first tie in over 25 year, I am once again n the brink of homelessness. I am heartened by reading your blog, but I cannot help but notice things that stand out as major concerns for me, that obviously were not a concern for you as a male. </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/6344498994560048706'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/6344498994560048706'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html?showComment=1369782681019#c6344498994560048706' title=''/><author><name>Samantha</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109915381192378495' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109915381192378495' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-544668807"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:11 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4654375903443263949</id><published>2013-02-27T17:37:49.617-08:00</published><updated>2013-02-27T17:37:49.617-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I&amp;#39;ve been staying at a shelter called Mission ...</title><content type='html'>I&amp;#39;ve been staying at a shelter called Mission Solano in Fairfield, California off and on now for about two years, since just after my 18th birthday. These articles really speak to me, I&amp;#39;ve been going through nearly identical crap now for my entire adult life. I now hold a deep resentment for religious dogma, and constantly berate or snap at people of a religous persuasion. I wasn&amp;#39;t like this when I was younger. Sure, I&amp;#39;ve always been against religion, but I never got into drawn out debates or talked down to people with faith. Now I can&amp;#39;t help it. Mission Solano bred within me a deep contemptment for Christianity and most everyone that practices it. These so called &amp;quot;blessed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;godly&amp;quot; people look at you like a piece of trash, and treat you like dogshit. The facade of a smile is on their face, but their eyes tell all. They hate you. You&amp;#39;re a drug addict, drunkard, sinner, criminal, a useless bum in their eyes. My homosexuality makes it even worse, whenever its mentioned its &amp;quot;my choice&amp;quot;, like I woke up one day and said &amp;quot;Boy, I sure would like a cock right about now!&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve never been attracted to women in my life. I followed the norm for society until I turned 17, put away me fear, and came out. These Christians look upon you with such loathing and distrust you can feel it physically, deep down in your gut and in your soul. I&amp;#39;ve just recently got the balls to get out of the system that I hated and relied on, and I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/4654375903443263949'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/4654375903443263949'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html?showComment=1362015469617#c4654375903443263949' title=''/><author><name>Anthony K</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109915381192378495' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109915381192378495' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-275982306"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:37 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2668457948852548515</id><published>2012-11-13T14:37:38.048-08:00</published><updated>2012-11-13T14:37:38.048-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I tried doing the shelter thing.

Around here, they have this program where they shuttle you off to a different church each week. I don&amp;#39;t mind the churches so much, I happen to be a Christian, but to me it is a very personal and private thing and I resent being proselytized. What bugs me is the level of condescension and contempt I encountered. I had to take a breathalyzer every day, sometimes more than one, although I have not had a drink in 15 years. Generally, I was treated as if I were an alcoholic, drug addict, and common criminal. One night, staying in this drafty old church, I was really cold. So the next night, I asked the guy in charge if he had an extra blanket. No, he replied, then he told me that he had set the thermostat at 68 degrees, same as his house, as if to imply that I had no right to be cold, then he told me that it was better than sleeping outside. First of all, what a crummy thing to say. Second, what a crummy thing to hear from a guy who has never actually spent a night outside. But last night was the proverbial final straw. After a full day at work at my full time job, I drove to the shelter, went inside to check in, ate some dinner, then went back out to my vehicle to retrieve some of my pposessions. The lady in charge chased me into the parking lot with the breathalyzer, made me blow, then informed me that I was not permitted to go back out to my vehicle after checking in. I asked her why and she replied that it was against the rules. I had had enough. I told her that I could not take being treated this way any longer and that I was leaving. That&amp;#39;s your choice, she replied. I then thanked her for acknowledging that I was allowed to have a choice, then turned around and left. I will never return to that horrible program.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/2668457948852548515'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/2668457948852548515'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html?showComment=1352846258048#c2668457948852548515' title=''/><author><name>Steve</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109915381192378495' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109915381192378495' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1800646426"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="2:37 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3675037952469760769</id><published>2012-02-06T20:07:55.213-08:00</published><updated>2012-02-06T20:07:55.213-08:00</updated><title type='text'>02/06/2012&#xa;&#xa;Been down every path in life, looking ...</title><content type='html'>02/06/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been down every path in life, looking for tips came across this blog, freekin awsum! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im 35 now. Mom bounced when I was very young never saw here again. My dad a was a logger till he almost got cut in half and became permanently disabled. Dude a violent piece of crap. Homeless couch serfing living in car, camping till I Graduated high school then almost immediately  did a year for committing felony burglary. Construction for 10 years, alcoholism early on big time, I was able to give up,still sober to this day. Later on drugs after ex fiance got me hooked prescription pain pills which I gave up, the mother of all addictions. Still after all these years fein for that crap daily.  Construction took dump lost all I worked for, foreclosure, car repoed. Got job without car bought car, homeless shelter one night lived in car few weeks, moved back into ex for a while. Hooked up with her friend and moved in with here while working full time temping making decent cash. Couldnt stand her moved into car for about 5 months then into trucking for last few years. Just rolled semi-truck now homeless going to buy a small mini-van with small amount of saved up funds and go that route till I get another job. Sorry bout run on sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spent about 3hrs reading about everything in this blog, once again friggen awsum!  A few things from my perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Beggars cant be choosy&amp;quot; My opinion of a beggar; someone who has underling mental condition, alcoholic, and or junkie (I aint judging, been there), people who mentally become victims to there circumstance and choose not to fight it(depression). People who are just lazy with no self esteem or others.  The lost soles or the helpless.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who want to better themselves and who have the ability to do so, should choose at all cost stay out of the shelters. Two quotes I remember I forget from where; &amp;quot;If you put a low price tag on yourself, no one else will raise the price&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;If you dont stand for something you will fall for anything&amp;quot; Homeless shelters for all there good intentions do nothing but try to lower the price tag on everyone.  If you choose to live in a shelter its just a matter of time b4 u submit and lower your own personal value of yourself to where you consider yourself no more of value than the norm (as stated above) of shelter residents. In a car or other you can maintain your personal self esteem or personal value.  You want 2 get a job and a better life very little speaks to potential employers like self confidence. Want to get laid? Chicks just dig guys who have there head down with a &amp;quot;who is me attitude&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing. Avoid the temptation of drugs and alcohol at all cost. Your in this situation you need a clear sharp mind, just like in chess sharpness and aggressiveness (hitting the pavement every morning with the boots down lookin for work) is the key.  Both serious addictions I had, I gave up after looking around and seeing the alcoholics and junkies in the shelters just seeing lost soles, death, people existing for no other reason than to exist whom maby death would be better. Those are the long term residents of shelters who will not hesitate to bring you down to there level.  Stay sharp.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never ever give up hope! Never drop the value of yourself or let anybody else drop it for you.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/3675037952469760769'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/3675037952469760769'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html?showComment=1328587675213#c3675037952469760769' title=''/><author><name>imasquirrel</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01046244727295342959</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109915381192378495' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109915381192378495' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1825450842"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:07 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4586322288990413960</id><published>2012-02-03T11:27:49.889-08:00</published><updated>2012-02-03T11:27:49.889-08:00</updated><title type='text'>&amp;quot;Can&amp;#39;t you get a cheap car and do it my w...</title><content type='html'>&amp;quot;Can&amp;#39;t you get a cheap car and do it my way?

I have even heard from some very large muscular men that they are afraid of these places. I once knew a man who loved a Christian Illinois shelter. This was a place where people were regularly searched for drugs, and or alcohol upon entering. Well, this guy used to get there around the first of the month to get close to the crack heads. The third of the month, when the dopers get their social security checks, he got rich. I receive a disability check, but can&amp;#39;t afford a place to live. If I get a job for any amount of time, I will lose medicine that I need to live. I went to a health club, and by swimming for long periods was able to repair the left lobe of my heart. The heart is a muscle. If I could find employment that would allow me to earn enough money to live on I would be very happy. People that have had good intentions in the past have tried to engage me in programs that don&amp;#39;t work.Quite sadly these same people have judged my lifestyle,and said that nobody would hire me because of my age. Shades of Soylent Green! Somebody from Wal-Mart complained to the police about my sleeping there. I was told that I could no longer sleep there. I can shop there, but not sleep there. Police wanted me to go to a shelter, but I told them I can&amp;#39;t because I have a small dog. He let it go then. I am running out of places to go. At Wal-Mart there was a homeless man who also parked there every night. He was a nice man, and I felt protected when he was around. Is there anyone who would like to join with me in finding a safe place?

I heard about a christian shelter that was run a couple of blocks away.  i inquired, got trained, and then manned the shelter about 3 times before they no longer required my services.  you see, one night one of the homeless was having a very difficult time sleeping and got up and wanted to talk at a table with anyone.  we were conversing quietly for about 20 minutes before some &amp;quot;control freak&amp;quot; came over and told the man to go lay down.  I explained to the oppressor the situation and he cited &amp;quot;the rules&amp;quot; and what would happen if everyone wanted to stay up?  I really though he was kidding for a moment, it was so ludicrous!  He persisted, and rather than make a scene, i suggested that he go lay down.  I was contacted by a woman in the organization a few days later.  Apparently, the control freak made out an incident report and she wanted my side.  i told her and they never called me back.  in my opinion, their attitudes lacked compassion, understanding and christian charity and if they wanted to run it that way, i didn&amp;#39;t want any part of it.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/6602018339798363893'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/6602018339798363893'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html?showComment=1320037821011#c6602018339798363893' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109915381192378495' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109915381192378495' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1699260275"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:10 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-5236118173043435774</id><published>2011-06-05T17:20:30.037-07:00</published><updated>2011-06-05T17:20:30.037-07:00</updated><title type='text'>About an hour ago someone left a comment telling m...</title><content type='html'>About an hour ago someone left a comment telling me about all the things he believed homeless people are.

What you describe here is the best of shelters. Even when you pay $5 a night, its just like this. The free shelters are worse. As you say, the people working and running the shelters have the best of intentions, but the result is what it is. Something to note: most of the first line shelter workers are homeless folks that have entered whatever &amp;#39;program&amp;#39; the shelter offers. I remember at the $5 shelter, a man named Dave who loved to threaten barring, even though he entered the shelter a couple days after me. But he entered the program, so he gained that power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelters are horrific, degrading, paternalistic kindness at its finest. &amp;#39;m couch-surfing now, but if I hadn&amp;#39;t burnt the bridge at the $5 shelter by speaking my mind, I&amp;#39;d go back, cuz couch-surfing sucks, too. The whole situation is hideous.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/6737528334130782695'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/6737528334130782695'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html?showComment=1306815025082#c6737528334130782695' title=''/><author><name>David</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15204191945608018879</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109915381192378495' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109915381192378495' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-871059394"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="9:10 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1908195658109574843</id><published>2010-11-18T17:40:13.105-08:00</published><updated>2010-11-18T17:40:13.105-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I had heard the shelter near me is horrible but th...</title><content type='html'>I had heard the shelter near me is horrible but they still give out food to those who show up from 7:30 - 8:30 PM.

I had the good fortune of finding a Christian shelter during the rainy months of Northern California, where I would have surely been discovered early morning frozen to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelter I had stayed at feed you, sign in was quick, but time-sensitive. Before the dinner though, they either had preachers come in and preach at you, or would put on one of those video taped sermons. I remember, from the very first day I was there, I would ask every preacher who showed up as they were leaving if they would like to stay and have dinner with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;ll let you guess how many said yes. I had endured the words of men who would call themselves followers of Christ, because the alternative was death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before letting you have a bed, you had to take a shower. They provided pajamas. Oh, you had to shower with three other dudes, at the same time, in a.... I&amp;#39;m gonna say 20 foot by 20 foot public shower. Was it actually that? I don&amp;#39;t know, I&amp;#39;ve never actually measured it. But I endured it, because the alternative was death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did manage to luck out, and land a job, and eventually get myself back onto my feet. Would I stay at a shelter again if I were to go homeless?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only if the alternative is death.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/6552194331347371951'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109915381192378495/comments/default/6552194331347371951'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html?showComment=1276949085530#c6552194331347371951' title=''/><author><name>NAB</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-2.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109915381192378495' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109915381192378495' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1431998281"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:04 AM"/></entry></feed>

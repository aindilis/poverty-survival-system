I live in my van near beaches mainly due to toilet facilities and nice bracing showers during summer. I have found free hot showers by word of mouth and if things get tight money wise I know where to get a free meal or a bakery that sells its old stock for $1.50 a bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear people say that they usually get saved in the nick of time. Job turns up when desperately needed, a couch becomes available or you close a much needed deal. But guess what...it doesn&amp;#39;t always come up roses. For me one after another I lost jobs, ventures just don&amp;#39;t come off. One after another after another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what I am trying to say is homelessness is generally forced on people. Not planned. I am far better off than most homeless. I have a vehicle to live in and a nice environment  to while away the time. But most importantly I have hope.  </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/316266074445040449'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/316266074445040449'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html?showComment=1437795501443#c316266074445040449' title=''/><author><name>Steve</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109831369489082264' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109831369489082264' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-555406524"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:38 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1810249451642320259</id><published>2014-12-28T21:48:57.094-08:00</published><updated>2014-12-28T21:48:57.094-08:00</updated><title type='text'>12/28/2014...

I recently have been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and I am in severe pain chronic pain.  They are running tests to determine cause of it, like ms or another autoimmune disorder. My problem is I currently live with my fiance who no longer wants me as a dependant.  I have not worked at his request for 3 1/2 years to take care of him and his children.  I am not living up to my end of the bargain and can no longer cook, clean, shop due to my extreme pain.  I am in bed with ice on my feet constantly and most of the time can not walk on my feet.  I have been working since I was 15 (except the last 3) and was a clinical research coordinator making good money.  Now I make nothing.  I do get food stamps monthly.  My problem is I live in the desert in California and I do not have a car.  Everything we have he believes is his and is in his name anyway.  I am petrified by fear of being on the streets with no car, at least then I would feel safe.  I am terrified of being raped or worse.  I am cognitively impaired as well due to this disorder that they are trying to diagnose, but can not mentally work especially when you factor in the strong medications I am taking.  Half the time I am a zombie.  This is not a good state to be in if you are a homeless female.  I do not have any family and do not have any friends as my two dearest friends have passed recently.  Any advice to point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.  Also my Dr. appointments are 15 miles away from the nearest shelter.  Please please if you have any information!!!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/158586718928348022'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/158586718928348022'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html?showComment=1404819325833#c158586718928348022' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109831369489082264' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109831369489082264' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-2032274495"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:35 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-246826236718295180</id><published>2013-12-06T01:25:27.243-08:00</published><updated>2013-12-06T01:25:27.243-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I&amp;#39;ve been homeless and with no assistance for ...</title><content type='html'>I&amp;#39;ve been homeless and with no assistance for 3+ years fresh out of high school. No family. No friends. And I get chased out of every place I try to stay by the cops. Adding to the stress. No one wants to help or cares cuz its not their problem. N try getting a job when u can&amp;#39;t even do simple shit like shower, wash ur clothes, cut ur hair, shave, ppl look at u like I&amp;#39;ve done something wrong jus adding to the insult. Then if u have the slightest record its even worse. Plus living outside gives no security and exposes u to desiese and extreme wether. It takes all ur energy just to find a place to be comfortable. If u do get a job that actually pays enough to dig u out of the situation ( not likely if u have no specific trade) u still have to deal with all that shit save every penny and starve yourself of everything every other human takes for granted. And hope u might eventually make it to the point where u can crawl up in ur own something and relax for five fukin seconds. The odds are against the homeless and no one really cares. N now its next to impossible to get a real job in this economy on top of all this. So mostly its a lot of sitting around wondering if tomorrow is the day ill die or if ur willing to risk doing something illegal that u don&amp;#39;t want to and ending up in jail with shifty ppl n shitty cops who don&amp;#39;t care if u live or die. If u become homeless and have no friends or family, no resources like a car, phone, income, u gotta do whatever desperate imbarresing act u hafto to keep from fukin dying and avoid goin to jail for it. Its the biggest fukin insult to life just as tramatic as anything and could kill neone and definatly ruins innocent lives and destroys decent ppl who never asked for it and tried every thing to avoid, stop, and change it. N that&amp;#39;s everyday for my 23 yo ass. Future gone. Things getting worse. State wants money I don&amp;#39;t have. No resources. Facing Grimm fukin death. Stole everything I have to survive. Got a record. Not gettin ne better n not gonna Cath a break. Bout to loose my food stamps n ill Rollin starve.  And its winter so ill prolli freeze to fukin death. N despite all my overwhelming effort can&amp;#39;t cath a break to change my fate.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/246826236718295180'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/246826236718295180'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html?showComment=1386321927243#c246826236718295180' title=''/><author><name>cody claeys</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/04284062458244063306</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109831369489082264' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109831369489082264' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-717308108"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="1:25 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2651590833698332832</id><published>2013-10-30T15:26:57.543-07:00</published><updated>2013-10-30T15:26:57.543-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I know from my experiences that there is strength ...</title><content type='html'>I know from my experiences that there is strength in numbers.&lt;br /&gt;Many people live as a predatory animal.

Homelessness isn&amp;#39;t something I want to consider but it&amp;#39;s looking like the thing to do. I&amp;#39;m 19 and at a loss. I can&amp;#39;t afford school thanks to the brilliant Canadian student loan system, and frankly.. I have no idea what I would want to take. The best degree will lead me into debt and a minimum wage job. &lt;br /&gt;I know that lots of people may read this as childish ignorance-- particularly when I say that I cannot turn to my family. But I&amp;#39;ve watched them fall into debt and stress to the point of poor health. All over money and obligation to take care of my other siblings. And I WILL NOT add to their troubles. In a backwards sense, I want the best for my parents. I want them to know retirement and good health. &lt;br /&gt;I did try to turn to my twin in all of this but she&amp;#39;s busy living the high life. She actually cried when she heard I was considering moving to the city she lives in because that&amp;#39;s where I could potentially get a job. .. Then to boot, my entire network of friends and family discouraged me from taking the opportunity because they sympathized with my sisters plight. The poor girl is just trying to find her independence. How cruel am I to take that opportunity away from her.. My pride is sore. But I suppose this is the first step. isn&amp;#39;t it. &lt;br /&gt;Lovely story telling takes place in these comments. In any case,fine sir, you are changing lives with this blog. Thank you for the hope. &lt;br /&gt;A wise woman told me once that hope is the only thing we&amp;#39;re entitled to.

I had a $100,000 job; but was laid off. I had one of the cars repossessed and I know live in the other one (2010 VW Tourage with a $785 payment). That was her last straw. I have not seen my 4 year old daughter since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facts: I had a multi-million dollar business, was on the cover of fortune mag,and have an MBA. When she kicked me out I thought I would just get another $100,000 sales job and be ok. It did not happen. I have paid for my car with 10 different jobs or paychecks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to have nice clothes so I can get interviews. But &amp;quot;I know&amp;quot; my situation. I recently found a good $100,000 sales job; but now I have to incorporate and get a bank account and I have shot credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is always something; however, the more you keep pushing forward, things tend to get better. I belong to 24-hour super sport and wash there and work on computer at starbucks until night time. I park in 24-hour fitness parking lot. They cant kick me out; i am a memeber!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what I have learned is that &amp;quot; I am not my things&amp;quot;; I need to be more grateful for what I have. If I do this; when I get back on my feet - I will be a much better person, ready to help others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live on protein powder that I buy at 24 hour fitness and have a good sales job. But,something always seems to happen and screw it up. I am hoping this will stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want everyone out there to understand this is all a test. its how you react to your circusmstances that will free you; not lamenting over the bad circumstances. stay strong!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/7711433828310989688'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/7711433828310989688'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html?showComment=1339208925491#c7711433828310989688' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109831369489082264' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109831369489082264' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1924705465"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="7:28 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1920014369621073706</id><published>2012-05-17T04:30:28.040-07:00</published><updated>2012-05-17T04:30:28.040-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Some of us who are houseless, are not homeless.

More than that, instead of waiting to run out of money, I actually pulled the trigger early and left my apartment way before my savings ran out. This ensured me a good buffer fund and a good place to start off a new life with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now espouse the mentality of planning ahead and beating your own financial setback to the punch by slashing all your expenses so your job earnings can pile up into a neat stack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going homeless just as you run out of money is the wrong way to approach it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If at all possible, you must approach this from a position of strength. This means beating the creditors and landlords and not allowing them to sap your savings further. Screw the credit score, it&amp;#39;s never gonna be good enough for them, anyway. They will almost always deny your loan applications so what&amp;#39;s the point? If you see trouble ahead in a few months, don&amp;#39;t wait. You can always rebuild when you do get that cushy job. This is about survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&amp;#39;s between them and you, choose YOU!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/1920014369621073706'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/1920014369621073706'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html?showComment=1337254228040#c1920014369621073706' title=''/><author><name>AsianGypseh  (the food lover)</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08137716203543697662</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KQFRRCxg1nY/TiUYFSdQ4iI/AAAAAAAAAAU/xqGzsDfkZHY/s220/P1060728.JPG'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109831369489082264' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109831369489082264' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-937175389"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:30 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6836414441015396820</id><published>2012-05-17T04:17:55.474-07:00</published><updated>2012-05-17T04:17:55.474-07:00</updated><title type='text'>One of the things I noted in my vehicle dwelling i...</title><content type='html'>One of the things I noted in my vehicle dwelling is how MORE stable my finances actually became.

In the last 7 years I have been without a job for maybe a week, and in truth I had applied at a job on a Friday, quit the one that I was working that Saturday as well as getting a call for an interview for the job that I had applied at the day before.  So, no, I am not a bum who refuses to work.  I have lived with my aunt after getting screwed by a roommate last year, then fell in love with a wonderful man.  Due to my not being there as much, though I did pay rent just to sleep on a couch, she decided that her house was not a storage area and that I should leave.  Fine, I had bought a sailboat and lived aboard her for a couple of months before I had to sell her.  I lived in an RV that I had bought for a while, and yes, he does have a home.  When he and I broke up for about a day-a week, I moved back in with my aunt.  We got back together, and are getting married in late June.  My aunt has decided that since I have left a few clothes on the floor of the living room (where I sleep) and she found bedbugs in my sheets and blankets (though she had had that problem before), that if I don&amp;#39;t fix it by the end of May, then she is going to ask that I leave.  I happen to enjoy owning a truck, I will not live with my fiancee until we are married (some values are worth keeping), and since I have no intention of bowing to anyone much less remaining in an unstable home, I have decided to get back to being a gypsy.  Is it worth the trouble to have to struggle to pay for a mobile home for a month and a half or a motel room for the same time when you earn minimum wage?  What better way to live than with the wind beneath your wings lifting you up?  What better way to live than to follow your own rules and not those that society dictates that you follow?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/4327380945141846528'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/4327380945141846528'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html?showComment=1336083046299#c4327380945141846528' title=''/><author><name>Lanisia</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109831369489082264' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109831369489082264' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-594849064"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="3:10 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4660028591320498839</id><published>2012-02-01T05:11:00.303-08:00</published><updated>2012-02-01T05:11:00.303-08:00</updated><title type='text'>You think it can&amp;#39;t happen to you.

Then some ENEMY calls the &amp;quot;authorities&amp;quot; on a charge of &amp;quot;child endangerment&amp;quot; which means you get invaded, there is no  defense against that invasion, they are  coming in.  First they find out your children are OK. But they look around and   start cataloging ANYTHING else they can hit you with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case it was six disabled people in a mobile home, with a cancerous wife, who worked when she could.And three  disabled kids who were much better at making messes than cleaning them up. Housekeeping. Add to housekeeping, a broken water Pipe on Christmas morning, and  a shorted out  circuit from the water. This all the day AFTER Christmas. In a mobile home water and  floors don&amp;#39;t mix. Wet floors means COLLAPSE. So I am dealing with  wet floors, a collapse, and half the electricity out in a home which needs a maid badly. The  Child Protection people leave, BUT they call the Health inspector who comes out that afternoon, thinks I am overwhelmed, and RED TAGS The HOUSE. Then they say I have  24 hours to vacate the children or I lose them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can happen to you too.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/4660028591320498839'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/4660028591320498839'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html?showComment=1328101860303#c4660028591320498839' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109831369489082264' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109831369489082264' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-933131897"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:11 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3414361196511988451</id><published>2012-01-29T23:48:40.699-08:00</published><updated>2012-01-29T23:48:40.699-08:00</updated><title type='text'>To the previous post of 1/29: you could not have p...</title><content type='html'>To the previous post of 1/29: you could not have picked a better site. I would recommend that you read all of the entries, esp. those about day to day living and what to expect. You seem to have a good attitude and that&amp;#39;s the key right there. Do Be Aware. Con artists and just all-around baddies do seem to be out there so don&amp;#39;t open yourself up too much at first. I&amp;#39;m sure a man of your years does not need much advice in this direction but let me reaffirm that vigilance is a necessary part of homeless living. I am sure you and your son are a good team and will resolve any difficulties you may encounter. Good luck to you, and to Mobile Homemaker, Thanks again!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/3414361196511988451'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109831369489082264/comments/default/3414361196511988451'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html?showComment=1327909720699#c3414361196511988451' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/im-not-bum.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109831369489082264' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109831369489082264' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-711042718"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="11:48 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-846323163180336516</id><published>2012-01-29T17:16:45.261-08:00</published><updated>2012-01-29T17:16:45.261-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Jan 29, 2012&#xa;&#xa;Almost homeless here too. 50s and wi...</title><content type='html'>Jan 29, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost homeless here too. 50s and will soon be on the street with my teenage son, here in Norther Colorado.

If you are older, choose a community college where they have older students and you fit in better. If you can enroll in a community college (take 1 unit or 1/2 unit gym class) on the cheap like it is in California, it is worth doing it. Now you are legit, you can use the gym showers legally. If you sneak in illegally, you won&amp;#39;t feel as at ease and you always be on the look out.

The owner traveled frequently, and so I took care of the day-to-day (checked guests in and out, made breakfast, cleaned rooms, walked dogs) and got my own room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, late in the third year, things are tougher for me. I work as a television and movie extra or as a brand ambassador and promotional work when I can. Often, as an extra, I have access to craft services and a secure place to sleep if the shoot goes overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find myself on the art gallery opening reception, academic lecture, free business networking event circuit quite often. I meet people, sign up for newsletters with more events, and make several passes at the food between networking conversations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#39;t enjoy the instability of my situation, but I&amp;#39;m trying to hang in there until a solid opportunity comes through for me. I continue to dress up for interviews. I try to maintain good relations and so continue to receive access to complimentary passes and other opportunities from people in my network, but I am also very discrete about my circumstances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People cannot seem to disguise their pity and contempt for those who are homeless. I&amp;#39;ve seen the anger and revulsion aimed at those who are less able than me to disguise their homeless status. Because of this, I&amp;#39;ll admit to acquaintences that I&amp;#39;m low-income and therefore cannot attend certain events, but never that I am homeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I&amp;#39;m saving my three-day LA Fitness trial pass and other freebies that I&amp;#39;ve collected and saved for emergencies.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/8981725084487032460'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/8981725084487032460'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html?showComment=1386026963099#c8981725084487032460' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109900201050670221' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109900201050670221' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-2125447766"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="3:29 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-5176440591640646503</id><published>2012-08-22T06:50:04.030-07:00</published><updated>2012-08-22T06:50:04.030-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I don&amp;#39;t know where everyone lives but in the U...</title><content type='html'>I don&amp;#39;t know where everyone lives but in the US, especially in places outside the cities its pretty easy to find abandoned vehicles.

I lost my job back in Chicago, then my home, so I used my savings to buy a 2005 Astro Van for 4500.  Its in fantastic condition: not a speck of rust or dirt on it so it blends into the middle class neighborhood perfectly.  To increase the stealth factor, I taped black paper sheets/blinds to the already tinted windows ($5 from walmart) and allows no light to enter or leave the van.  This makes it impossible for police or pesky people to see in with a flashlight. I also put up a black drape separating the bridge from the cabin so people can&amp;#39;t see in from the front with headlights.  I would recommend this form of stealth over the aforementioned car cover scheme.  I think that would be a dead giveaway and much more of a  hassle to get in and out.  Plus you can&amp;#39;t see out which makes it difficult to see if anyone is out walking their dog while you need to exit the vehicle in the morning. Although being stealthy is important, if you have even a decent looking vehicle you&amp;#39;ll be OK in San Diego.  There are SOOOO many people OBVIOUSLY living in RV&amp;#39;s here that if cops aren&amp;#39;t bothering them, you&amp;#39;ll be fine.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gutted the back of the van and have an air mattress elevated by a plywood frame.  Under the frame I store my tools, toiletries, clothing, food etc. During the day it functions as a couch. I have a bike rack on the back for carrying my bikes (I also have a mobile bike repair/restoration business I run to keep my occupied.) I usually carry several gallons of water and canned goods for emergency but otherwise I&amp;#39;ll go to a local grocery store and buy my food FOR THAT DAY so no fridge or cooler is necessary.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a membership at 24 hour fitness and do all my showering, shaving and changing clothes there not to mention I stay in great shape doing barbell/kettlebell training. Its only 30/month and WELL WELL worth it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need to get a UPS address cause eventually I&amp;#39;m going to have to find work so thanks for the advice on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you saw me you wouldn&amp;#39;t believe that I was homeless, but such is the way in these hard economic times.  I&amp;#39;ll eventually find a permanent home but until that time I&amp;#39;m going to enjoy the freedom and make the best of it. Good luck Everyone.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/7025039964266618645'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/7025039964266618645'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html?showComment=1321495118490#c7025039964266618645' title=''/><author><name>Morpheus</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109900201050670221' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109900201050670221' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1006842669"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:58 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8345181688275879205</id><published>2011-10-12T21:29:16.172-07:00</published><updated>2011-10-12T21:29:16.172-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Since I discovered this blog I decided to live fre...</title><content type='html'>Since I discovered this blog I decided to live free in my car inorder to save some money and to pay for my debt which occured as result of the divorce and the bad marriage. I am a woman and this blog gave me alot of information how to survive living in my car with dignity.&lt;br /&gt; I still have my part time job and I keep my work outfits clean and pressed all the time. I take my showers at the gym and still looking for better job to help me pay my future rent which I can not pay at the moment. I also got a UPS address. I usually choose places to park close to any 24 hour grocery store which until this moment after one month and half living in my car nobody brotherd me either from the people or the police. &lt;br /&gt;The only obsticle I am facing it now it  is very cold in Seattle now and it will become colder in november and Decemeber. I wear double thick layers.

I am not faminiest and I still believe in old values and I still believe in love and family which my ex husband did not care about and the cheating and the children out of the wedlock is his usual practice. &lt;br /&gt;I still have my faith and hope that my current tough time will become a good story to tell in the future and a good lesson to have so I can make better choices in the future.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/8345181688275879205'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/8345181688275879205'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html?showComment=1318480156172#c8345181688275879205' title=''/><author><name>RainWithHope</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109900201050670221' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109900201050670221' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1721474356"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="9:29 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3557391321128496999</id><published>2011-09-04T00:39:26.461-07:00</published><updated>2011-09-04T00:39:26.461-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Sitting here this morning reading this, has well, ...</title><content type='html'>Sitting here this morning reading this, has well, rekindled my drive to take another hiatus shall we say. I spent a year down in San Diego homeless, bouncing between Embassy Suites and other of the waterfront hotels posing as a guest, frequenting the pools / fitness centers. As long as you can keep your appearance neat and a certain swagger about you (you know the not a worry in the world presence) there is virtually not a door in the world you cant open with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to go ahead and get back out there, and just see where the world will bring me this time. I have a car now, so I am thinking that a truly nomadic experience is what is going to take place here over the next year at the least. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a habit of spontaneity and know that I will have a bit of explaining to do next week after I drop off the edge of my peers social world, I just cant remember when I have felt so good about myself since succeeding in well to put it bluntly - conning - my way around while still remaining largely within the limits of the law, aside from some occasional trespassing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot for the read. Maybe ill have some new experiences to share with some of your readers sometime in the future.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/3557391321128496999'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/3557391321128496999'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html?showComment=1315121966461#c3557391321128496999' title=''/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=750520649</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109900201050670221' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109900201050670221' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1087956072"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="12:39 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4364006916380476843</id><published>2011-08-29T20:51:59.285-07:00</published><updated>2011-08-29T20:51:59.285-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I have no idea how to respond.

However, since that time we have pulled it out of the fire and are doing fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, being on the brink of financial ruin has  lead us into a new world of downsizing, organizing, and frugality. The first thing that we did was prioritize and consolidate all our belongings so that it could fit into a 5&amp;#39;x10&amp;#39; storage locker (price $30 a month). This was no easy task since we had been accumulating junk for about 25 years. However, I discovered a great pawn shop that bought just about everything I would bring in from the smallest tool to large items like tool sheds and boats. We were able to hold on for months and months in our home just from these sales. The more expensive stuff we sold on Craigslist. Meanwhile I outfitted our SUV for survival living in case worst came to worst. Fortunately, I had put about $800 into maintenance the previous summer so it was in good shape...perfect for sleeping, tinted windows for privacy, and it gets good gas mileage. We then started living as if we were already homeless. Oatmeal with a couple of almonds/banana for breakfast, small salad for lunch, and a little protein/vege for dinner. We cut out everything else: alcohol, medications, and all luxury items. All non-essential bills were also cut off and everything else we could think of. I&amp;#39;m sure you have gotten the point by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I am no novice to this way of living and thinking. I once traveled across the US with a buddy by selling mobiles made out of coat hangers and am also an avid backpacker. I never feel as free as living high up in the mountains. I think the other thing that would make me suitable to this sort of living is that I was an old competitive swimmer and would always stay close to some body of water. This is the key for me anyway. I can swim, bathe, and fish for free. I am a good fisherman and yearly state licenses usually only cost around $25. Therefore, in this aquatic environment I can stay healthy, happy and clean. And, then for entertainment I use a small inflatable trail boat for fishing and exploring. Crawdads are also easy to catch too and excellent eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, we have not had to put these ideas into practical use yet, but, I find it almost exhilarating to prepare, prepare, prepare. These are desperate times and homelessness for millions of Americans is only one paycheck away.  But, as my wife said, &amp;quot;Lets just make it into another one of our adventures if things take a turn for the worst.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merry Xmas</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/4504797070295363975'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/4504797070295363975'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html?showComment=1292771335424#c4504797070295363975' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109900201050670221' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109900201050670221' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1406388512"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="7:08 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4036501728941875325</id><published>2010-12-13T03:54:08.915-08:00</published><updated>2010-12-13T03:54:08.915-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Dec. 13, 2010&#xa;I am about to be homeless in just a ...</title><content type='html'>Dec. 13, 2010&lt;br /&gt;I am about to be homeless in just a few months due to circumstances beyond my control. I have seen it coming and have spent long hours researching in preparation of this. This is a great site for information and I thank you for taking the time to &amp;quot;put it out there&amp;quot; for all that need it. If I may, there are a couple other sites that compliment the information here. One site, previously mentioned is workamper.com. They list literally hundreds of jobs available to people in RV&amp;#39;s, vans, etc. They are usually seasonal jobs lasting anywhere from a couple months to a year or even longer term if you choose. Another good site is vandwellers.org. They list a ton of good info on living out of your car or van, how to convert the space you have to do so, how to stay warm, stealth, and many many other things related to living in all sorts of vehicles. Keep up the site here. It really is a good one.

You will need a real post office (not one in a store for example) and simply find the window marked &amp;quot;General Delivery&amp;quot;. In smaller PO&amp;#39;s it may be the same counter for sending mail. You can receive mail and they will hold if for 30 days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody really uses pagers anymore. A pre-paid cell phone (Tracfone) can be had for $20 and refilled with $10 of airtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew a guy that made over $100 a day (average) while flying a sign (hungry, please help!) while at a busy intersection. I wasn&amp;#39;t convinced, so he invited me to give it a try. I was wearing an old Army jacket and I made about $20 in an hour...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that isn&amp;#39;t your cup of tea (it&amp;#39;s not mine) day labor gigs can be had at places like Labor Ready. You need to be there very early (about 5AM) and you may/may not get a job. If you do it will pay minimum wage and you will get docked for taxes, if you need a ride, etc. But you will get a check at the end of the day or you can get paid by a ATM like machine inside the office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donate blood plasma. If you&amp;#39;re able to (healthy, no blood diseases)you can easily make $50 a week for going into your local center twice a week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-food jobs are easy to get and come with free food while working. One needs to be clean and able to wait a few weeks before getting that first check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Job Corps (Federal DOL program all across the USA) offers free room &amp;amp; board, GED and HS classes, and vocational training to low-income folks aged 16-24. Excellent choice for homeless youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;California Conservation Corps recruits young folks (up to 25, I think) to work in remote labor camps in California. Free room, board, computer classes, GED/HS Dip fo those that need one and a steady 40 hours a week work (CA minimum wage). You can be from outta state, so anybody can grab a bus to California and join.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any prep time/money (for example, you will lose your housing in a month, job in a few weeks, etc) don&amp;#39;t buy a car. Sell a car if you have one. Buy a work van if at all possible. Ford Econoline (no side windows) for example. The cargo area is perfect for storing some things and a sleeping bag or even a mattress makes a comfy bed. It&amp;#39;s mobile.

Please, PLEASE do not do this.  At ANY time of day or night.  Yes, IF you get away with this, all of what he said you receive comes to you.  But the price of getting caught is not worth it.  &lt;br /&gt;     Casinos look for this kind of behavior, and doing stuff like will this only get you arrested.  They have many ways of catching you do what he mentioned, and they go out of their way to make their paying casino players comfortable-at the much too high expense of those that need to do this. &lt;br /&gt;     Plus they have private security that always feels like they can get away with more hassling and strong arm tactics that the actual police.  It&amp;#39;s because they know that they can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Bri, you are totally right-it is called theft, in the casino&amp;#39;s eyes, and although the casinos can afford to lose money, they will not tolerate their guests feeling like they are being cheated or stolen from...or even bothered by those that feel compelled to do this. &lt;br /&gt;     I tried this, so I know from experience. I was homeless last year in Arizona-a guy had left credits in a machine and actually left the casino!  It was a busy night (like Ryan mentioned to do this during), and so I took the credits from the machine and went to the cashier to cash them out.&lt;br /&gt;     Why not, right?  He didn&amp;#39;t seem to know about his money being there, and he did leave too.  The amount was $100 and change.  When I tried to cash the sheet that the machine gave out, the security people immediately took me into the office and the police were called.  &lt;br /&gt;   The entire while there, I was completly polite and cooperative.  The police were nice to me-but the security would have given me the death penalty if they could have. &lt;br /&gt;     Luckily they (the police-the security people were very nasty to me), took pity on me and just made me leave, but I was given a court date and spent time in jail for &amp;quot;theft of a device&amp;quot;.  The player that left got his money back (they knew who he was fron the sky cameras) and he was even offered the chance to sue me for even more than I &amp;quot;supposedly stole&amp;quot;.  He didn&amp;#39;t and I had nothing to give him anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    So it&amp;#39;s not worth it, folks.  You might as well walk into a bank, say your homeless and need money and then show off a gun, for the trouble it brings.  Nothing is worse than being homeless more than causing yourself more trouble in the name of desperation.  &lt;br /&gt;     Liek I said they look for this kind of thing and will make your life as bad as you can imagine.  Please trust me-I know it&amp;#39;s tough out there-I was homeless too and I always know it could happen again.  I know desperation and what it makes people do.  I never would have tried this, otherwise.

I&#39;m the one that has been living the lifestyle for over twenty years. First time blogging, so hope I&#39;m doing it right. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;It seems you have more then one audience.  Those just starting out with nothing but the clothes on their backs, and because of your blog, now have some basic supplies or money and then there are others a little further down the road, including being mobile.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So, if it&#39;s the homeless nomadic lifestyle for several months, that&#39;s one direction.  If one decides, like me, that I&#39;m not going back to the way it was, that is another. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I have the UPS mail addy and cell phone. Check Wal Mart the Trac Phones are $9.99 and the Net 10 phones $29.99 but comes with 300 minutes.  No contract, cxl at any time.  I&#39;m on a plan for $15.00 month for 150 min, if need more can add at $5 for 50 min in between.   &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I use Net Spend Visa or MC debit card (Ace Check Cashing and other outlets like Safeway, Fred Meyer etc are reloading centers.) Set up account by buying a $3.95 card. An aside, if a family member also has a Net Spend card, you can transfer money for free between accounts, that means no Western Union fees. Many employers have gone to direct deposit and a debit card is a necessity. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If I&#39;m in a metropolitan area, using all of Mobile Homemaker&#39;s tips on how to present yourself for a job, I hit a temp agency.  I show up every morning when they open their doors, presentable, with bright smiley face.  There is always someone calling in sick and I&#39;ve always been dispatched. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Temp agencies gives me the opportunity to see what&#39;s out there and the employer an opportunity to see what type of worker I am.  Many of the large company&#39;s do this because they don&#39;t have to worry about firing you if it is not working out - you are not their employee - but the temp agency&#39;s and they only need to say don&#39;t send them back. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The time I worked for over a year, I choose the company because I could work three 12 hour shifts on the weekend, paid for 40 hours and no management on site.  Sweet! &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Used the money I earned to upgrade and improve my living conditions. During the week days, I used my state park day pass to enjoy all amenities including RV dumps, showers, laundry facilities and water fills. Also, the fun stuff, bike riding, nature hikes, bird watching, swimming and just chilling.    &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;At night, drove to small shopping mall a mile up hill and parked on the back side to sleep.  In morning, went to gas station, brought coffee and newspaper and was at park entrance when opened.  Ka-Ching! &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I&#39;ve also bartered and worked for cash and parking space, when I worked on a ranch.  Even got a horse to ride. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Became a paid white water river guide on weekends and camped during the week at one of the federal parks &quot;free&quot; campgrounds, which are not listed but you have to inquire about with the Superintendent of the District. They are primitive- but the view - like being on a private reserve.  Also, BLM land is free or small fee camping.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Have always thought outside the box and have had some incredible work experiences, when needed, that does not interfere with my nomadic lifestyle.  It puts money in my pocket, but if you grow some of your food, stock up and hunker down, and stay in place for several weeks it cuts down on expenses.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/6252789104812976461'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109900201050670221/comments/default/6252789104812976461'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html?showComment=1238714880000#c6252789104812976461' title=''/><author><name>MzM</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/employment.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109900201050670221' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109900201050670221' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-152740699"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:28 PM"/></entry></feed>

I know that your idea of a book about homelessness has not panned out. I think it&amp;#39;s because you were meant to write a comprehensive memoir. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eloquence and insight that you bring to the subject of this blog would hold the same rapt attention for your readers were you to apply them to the rest of your experience - your childhood, return to &amp;quot;conventional&amp;quot; living, marriage and fatherhood, work, autism, society and politics, and all of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seen through your lens, and unified by your lived experience, it would be amazing. If you wrote it, some editor wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to put it down, and the rest, as they say, would be history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the process of finding a used mini-van with the last of my cash, and will be moving into it in 10 days. It is a long story, as you can imagine, and it&amp;#39;s not over yet. Terror has been present in the lead-up to this, among other things. However your words have been a godsend, and I, like so many of the rest of us, will continue to re-read them as I hide in plain sight and hope that the car keeps running until I catch my break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that I somehow thrive through this - wish me luck - and I hope that you write your book!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/6003131864797573086'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/6003131864797573086'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1407296731592#c6003131864797573086' title=''/><author><name>Away We Go!</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-2094232181"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:45 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-436194619498600623</id><published>2014-07-01T05:38:10.040-07:00</published><updated>2014-07-01T05:38:10.040-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Ehi..still there?? it is 2014 now.&#xa;I don&amp;#39;t how...</title><content type='html'>Ehi..still there?? it is 2014 now.&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#39;t how I came across your blog, but I find it fascinating; only don&amp;#39;t know if it is still active.&lt;br /&gt;I am a homeless..or individual living in a car.

Raising kids, dog, steady job, etc.  We chose the RV over an expensive house because we want few bills and we know bad things are coming.  For those of you who depend on social services, any kind of monthly entitlement check, or on charity from others, I&amp;#39;d like to give a word of caution.  I think times are coming when those of us living the American Dream will wake up to a shattered economy and collapsed civilization.  We will no longer be able to provide checks or charity, because we won&amp;#39;t even be able to provide for ourselves.  In many ways, homeless people already have a leg up on the coming collapse.  You&amp;#39;re already more smart and adaptable than the average American.  But go further.  Learn wild food gathering, water sourcing and purification, first aid, etc.  And stay safe.  There will be a lot of desperate people, and maybe it will be best to get invisible.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/526498675501508979'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/526498675501508979'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1381762681193#c526498675501508979' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-949513988"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="7:58 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8137428887894373308</id><published>2013-01-28T16:07:13.387-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-28T16:07:13.387-08:00</updated><title type='text'>You really do need to turn this into a book.

I&amp;#39;m an ex-felon, (20 plus years ago) and still can&amp;#39;t get hired. Looks like I&amp;#39;ll be paying for my crime the rest of my life. &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I do have a car, albeit a small one but I&amp;#39;m a camper/backpacker and therefore have much of what I need to manage nicely. &lt;br /&gt;I live in Central Illinois where it gets pretty cold in the winter and pretty hot and humid in the summer. I do have friends that leave for the winter and I think I&amp;#39;m going to camp out in the summer and see about staying in their house for the winter. I have a dog also so he will need attention especially in the colder months. &lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m so tired of fighting with bills, utilities and rent but I do have very little debt. Still owe one more year on my car and it&amp;#39;s mine. So, I figure I can save quite a bit of money doing this for a couple of years, just scared to begin I guess. It&amp;#39;s winter now so I think I&amp;#39;ll take the time to prepare and begin once it warms up. My biggest issue is trying to keep it a secret and not generating pity. I&amp;#39;d hate that. Don&amp;#39;t want to explain my reasons to family or friends. Accckkkk!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for the blog, it&amp;#39;s really helped me make a final decision. Just hope I make it. &lt;br /&gt;Good Luck to everyone trying to live this life!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/4498969073752170278'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/4498969073752170278'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1357398442560#c4498969073752170278' title=''/><author><name>unswydd</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16258664200418246054</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4AbUIcJM6rs/TjDCNUxRrwI/AAAAAAAAAAQ/HlwSMwbXsSI/s220/user892_pic2184_1272202200_thumb.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-838227837"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="7:07 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1322010138717027136</id><published>2012-09-02T15:42:47.700-07:00</published><updated>2012-09-02T15:42:47.700-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Mobile homemaker, i really sense your dedication t...</title><content type='html'>Mobile homemaker, i really sense your dedication to honesty. It seems to me that society is going through evolution. I hear a lot about helping people without hope,and having a stable lifestyle for the poor homeless children, and it strikes me that most of the thoughtless care, caustic shelter voluntears and ranting comments come from the assumption that nothing is normal about homeless living or any living different from &amp;quot;MINE&amp;quot; verses &amp;quot;THEM&amp;quot;. Is it not true that most of the world lives what is considered homeless? I know a family who raised  and educated 5 children while homeless, one of them autistic. All of her kids are successfull adults now, four of them with their own businesses, oh the autistic guy has his own I.T. business and is working on educating autistic kids. He he&amp;#39;s also a hi end auto mechanic, an awsome carpenter and supports his mom. They stay on the road a lot, i guess he&amp;#39;s some kind of consultant, nobody cares if the awsome guy acts wierd. Makes you think doesn&amp;#39;t it? I hope you get more on this blog about homeless families, and if i see one more comment about the hopeless homeless children, i&amp;#39;ll invite the guy to a family game night at the local tent city and see whose kids are hopeless. </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/1322010138717027136'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/1322010138717027136'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1346625767700#c1322010138717027136' title=''/><author><name>Jeeez</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1031144009"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="3:42 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1466715272032072181</id><published>2012-08-13T15:09:57.899-07:00</published><updated>2012-08-13T15:09:57.899-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I had another idea for a topic : sex.

I suspect and that at least within the next 6-8 months, unless there is a true act of God, that I will have to adopt a homeless lifestyle. I could not be more shocked as a 53-year-old woman, that this is how my life would turn out.  I have always been self-sufficient, raised a family, and did all the normal things that people do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the perfect example of how a single decision followed by an unrelated single injury can be the beginning of the end of what I knew life to be about.  You mentioned somewhere about how many paychecks it would take to become homeless...most of us have resources...selling things, pawning things, credit, etc., to squeak us by for a period of time, but I&amp;#39;m here to say that if paychecks don&amp;#39;t end up coming in for X amount of time, ANYONE can end up on the streets.  And it happens a lot faster than you can imagine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the biggest thing I am surprised about is the lack of empathy on the part of family and friends.  I now know that I am in this world ALONE.  I&amp;#39;m at the end of my ability to &amp;quot;hang on&amp;quot; as people tell you to do (hang on to what?).  &amp;quot;Something will happen,&amp;quot; (Yep...something&amp;#39;s happening all right - I&amp;#39;m getting ready to live in a car).  &amp;quot;The right job will come along again, you have so much experience!&amp;quot; (Nope....it doesn&amp;#39;t ALWAYS come along again!)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that I have never asked for any help from anyone.  Ever.  But, my family all knows my current situation and does nothing nor do they offer anything,  all the while with plenty of extra rooms in their homes. I was telling my brother the other day about finding out how people convert vans and trucks and live out of them, and that I was having to consider doing that. He didn&amp;#39;t even respond. Neither did his wife.  Really?  Your own brother doesn&amp;#39;t even respond? I was asking myself why.  I think people are plain uncomfortable with the whole idea of someone truly being down on their luck, unable to pull themselves out.  To accept that someone has REALLY exhausted all possibilities is to accept that THEY ALSO could end up that way someday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your friends are uncomfortable when you answer them honestly when they ask you, &amp;quot;How are you?&amp;quot;  They don&amp;#39;t really want to know.  When you share one thing about the truth of your life, they don&amp;#39;t even bother writing back. They can&amp;#39;t handle that kind of truth. I wonder if anyone really does want to hear that kind of truth...that a friend or family member is REALLY in trouble.  My &amp;quot;best friend&amp;quot; lives in a 1-Million dollar home with 9000 square feet, and even she has not offered to help. Every now and again she will throw in the comment, &amp;quot;If I could I would....&amp;quot;  (Really?  No you wouldn&amp;#39;t.  Just stop lying.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want anything from these people.  But I want them to want to help others.  I am literally shocked at how little people actually help others now that I&amp;#39;m the one who needs help.  I&amp;#39;m really shocked.  I see the world much differently now.  I always did help others, give to the homeless, etc., so I do not feel this is Karma. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of these things, I have lost hope in humanity as well as hope for any semblance of the belief of how my life was going to turn out.  I now am faced with incredible fear and realize that I can only count on ME.  I have ONLY ever counted on me, but I always thought that everyone would be here for each other.  Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you have actually been more helpful than my family and friends!  I thank you for that!  You have provided me with a wealth of information on how to proceed, how to survive, how to start, how to change my attitude (as hard as that will be), etc.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your valuable blog open so that others like me can be helped as well.  In our current state of the economy...I dare say that homelessness will become a problem that soon people will not be able to sweep under the rug any longer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/2658655381529979576'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/2658655381529979576'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1342643112078#c2658655381529979576' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1799828562"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="1:25 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3944984685739261303</id><published>2012-06-26T01:22:43.043-07:00</published><updated>2012-06-26T01:22:43.043-07:00</updated><title type='text'>It&amp;#39;s good to know that there is a resource lik...</title><content type='html'>It&amp;#39;s good to know that there is a resource like this out there on the web for people to see and use some of the ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m actually writing a book on my experiences being homeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 2003 until 2011 my home was my beat up oldsmobile cutlass supreme.  I roamed around quite a bit during that time, mostly as an itinerant student.  I have taken about 200 credits in coursework during those 8 years at quite a few great schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out at the University of Miami for two years (full-time), then started moving north where I spent a year at Clemson, then a year at George Washington, then a year at U Penn, then two years at Harvard, and finally went south-west a bit to spend a year at Carnegie Mellon, where I met my fiancee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I naturally did a lot of what you recommended during this time.  I got a mailbox at the local UPS store wherever I was that year and in some cases I was given a campus mailbox even though I was only a part-time student.  I have a nice collection of student IDs, haha, they&amp;#39;re great for the discounts at many places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the university wellness centers for hygiene most of the time and got a summer student YMCA membership during the non-academic year.  I always had access to high speed wireless networks via the campus and I could often park in the student lots and sleep there with little or no security worries.  While I was at UM, they had a policy where the psych stats class required a really cheap calculator ... for arithmetic but unable to do anything fancy, so loads of kids went out and bought $5-10 crap calculators for this purpose.  I took donations from literally hundreds of students and salvaged all the little solar panels from them, wired it all up and made a transformer to charge batteries.  I put this big array up in my back window of the cutlass during the day to charge my batteries that I used for all my electronics (including an electric blanket for winter warmth when I was up north).  I also converted my engine (V8 diesel) to biodiesel and was able to get 95% of my car&amp;#39;s fuel for free from local restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent loads of time sleeping in the car, and it was a great car to live in with a pretty big back seat for keeping lots of my junk and just throwing a blanket over it during the day.  The trunk was big enough for me to keep most of my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was employed during about 90% of the time I was homeless.  I held down work study jobs each semester.  Then during the summers I worked at a few summer boy scout camps where housing (a nice big tent with bed and bathroom/shower facilities) and dining hall food was provided.  I also worked at a large scale pretzel manufacturing facility in PA the summer before and summer after studying/living at U Penn.  I worked on the 2010 census too while I was at Harvard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m finally settling down this August with my fiancee.  We found a nice little efficiency to share in Pittsburgh (we met while she was finishing her masters at CMU)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next challenge is actually trying to get a career going, which might be a little tough considering I don&amp;#39;t have any degrees despite having earned a BS, MS, and an MBA (assuming I would have only been at 1 school rather than 6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did manage to network pretty well, so who knows, it might not be quite as bad.  I&amp;#39;m thinking about taking actuarial exams since it seems like you can get a job in that field assuming you can pass enough exams ... they might forgive the fact that I have almost 200 credits but no physical diplomas.  For what it&amp;#39;s worth, my transcripts all piled up look pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for even having this resource available for the current generation of technologically able (internet using) homeless population ... and for just shedding some light on the whole situation.  I hope your blog helps diminish ignorance of people who think that homeless people are dangerous or that it&amp;#39;s some sort of sin to not have a mortgage.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/3944984685739261303'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/3944984685739261303'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1340698963043#c3944984685739261303' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-892797250"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="1:22 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2661808800397717594</id><published>2012-05-07T09:34:50.731-07:00</published><updated>2012-05-07T09:34:50.731-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Hey Mobile Homemaker,&#xa;As many have said in posts, ...</title><content type='html'>Hey Mobile Homemaker,&lt;br /&gt;As many have said in posts, I stumbled across this blog recently, while trying to prepare for the unexpected condition of homelessness that may happen to me soon.

Stay humble about that, but you definitely deserve the praise.  You have given so many people a strong sense of confidence.  You provide a powerful surge of reassurance that can only come from being well informed and fully prepared.  I saw your original posts are from 2004.  And this is 2012.  Imagine that!  Your longevity is incredible!  I also noticed in your &amp;quot;Current Status of the Blog&amp;quot; section that you seemed to doubt the end-game value of your enormous efforts.  It seems you are asking what the end-result point was, because you&amp;#39;ve never really experienced a &amp;quot;tangle payoff&amp;quot; you could appreciate.  But let me assure you, in no uncertain terms, you are indeed benefitting from all your efforts, and benefitting every minute.  Even if you can&amp;#39;t understand or embrace that fact, it&amp;#39;s true.   I&amp;#39;ve seen your views about not believing in any god, and that&amp;#39;s perfectly fine.  But I&amp;#39;m convinced that there are definitive, undeniable signs of cause and effect everywhere.  I also see distinctive evidence of masterful design and intent as well.  What does that mean?  I honestly don&amp;#39;t know. However, I do believe that religion is definitely NOT the answer, and I have personal theories, but that&amp;#39;s not the point.  Also, I certainly realize the perfectly RANDOM nature of all movement in life can cause any person to permanently disavow any creative causality.  And that&amp;#39;s perfectly fine too.  But I can assure you of another thing with great confidence:  Cause and effect relationships are in very much in play in our world, regardless of what anyone believes.  If you sow seed, you will reap a harvest.  Period.  That&amp;#39;s just logic and physics.  So trust me, when it comes to handing out free and extremely valuable advice about being homeless, you&amp;#39;re practically Johnny Appleseed.  And you can trust that your efforts have already created an infinite &amp;quot;return benefit&amp;quot; loop, because your fine work is so greatly needed and appreciated, whether you can truly believe that or not.  Your reward system is permanently in place now, and it will last forever, especially since that was not your original intention at all in the first place.  So stop sowing here if you want, or keep going.  I recommend you keep throwing that seed around everywhere.  I promise you, it&amp;#39;s a lucrative investment opportunity with long-term benefits!&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work my friend!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/2661808800397717594'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/2661808800397717594'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1336408490731#c2661808800397717594' title=''/><author><name>Aaron</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1183471047"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="9:34 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7787245752923162160</id><published>2012-04-24T03:37:19.428-07:00</published><updated>2012-04-24T03:37:19.428-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Iv been readying your blog for the past few days. ...</title><content type='html'>Iv been readying your blog for the past few days. And everytime I read it, tears burn my eyelids. Im a26 year old female who will lose her housing on May 1. I have decided to just live homeless because getting an apartment or renting a room would just put me back in the situtation I am in now. I am attempting to pay off all my debt and finish college so one day I can afford to live life how I choose. Of course this is the hardest decision I have ever had to make. And everytime I think about it, i ask myself am I really ready for such a lifestyle. After reading your blog, I am comforted in knowing this one thing, I WILL BE OK. Your blog explore areas and avenues that I had not considered. And after reading your blog I realised that I am in a pretty decent situtaion. I have a car that runs. I have a job. I work the graveyard shift so I wont have to be on the streets at night. During the day, I could visit the Mall, Library, Movies and other areas of interest. My only problem is getting some sleep. But considering everything else, Im sure Ill be able to work that problem out. I want to thank you so much for sharing your knowledge. It has helped me ALOT!!! Mostly with my attitude. I have a more positive outlook on things. So here&amp;#39;s to being homeless!!!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/7787245752923162160'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/7787245752923162160'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1335263839428#c7787245752923162160' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-938129334"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="3:37 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8197426835701538258</id><published>2012-03-10T21:17:05.945-08:00</published><updated>2012-03-10T21:17:05.945-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Hi Mobile Homemaker, Just wanted to thank you for ...</title><content type='html'>Hi Mobile Homemaker, Just wanted to thank you for all the work you put into this blog over the years. I am not currently homeless, nor have I ever been, but I do live on a sailboat, and it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s an expensive sailboat, but one I picked up for about $800. It&amp;#39;s big enough to live on, and I really like the lifestyle, but even though the boat was cheap, there are always hidden expenses, especially with boats. Anyway, I recently lost my job and I may have to leave the boat and live on the streets for awhile. I can&amp;#39;t even afford the boat anymore. Your website has given me a lot of ideas, and more than that, it has shown me that being homeless isn&amp;#39;t the end of the world. I like the fact that you always tried to encourage the dignity in people, and showed that there is actually a bright side to being homeless. It&amp;#39;s all in the way you look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to down-grade you for getting your life together as one of the other posters did. Nor am I going to call you a traitor or demand that you publish your book. People move on. You were homeless once and you learned a great deal from that experience. You were good enough to share that knowledge with the rest of us, and I salute you. Congratulations on your new life, and thanks again for your insight and your support to all of those are either homeless or curious about how to survive.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/8197426835701538258'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/8197426835701538258'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1331443025945#c8197426835701538258' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-697253421"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="9:17 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2959841368108485472</id><published>2012-02-25T12:57:59.266-08:00</published><updated>2012-02-25T12:57:59.266-08:00</updated><title type='text'>i spent some time in the army a few tours i got a ...</title><content type='html'>i spent some time in the army a few tours i got a tatto on my side its says we were born, with hearts of gold as, we grow old our hearts turn cold.. i know the heart ach and pain that this world can display and thatks for ur story youve really inspired me..</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/2959841368108485472'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/2959841368108485472'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1330203479266#c2959841368108485472' title=''/><author><name>Matt1652</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03897690008781131104</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1591505801"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="12:57 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7506497038002467238</id><published>2012-02-25T12:49:07.518-08:00</published><updated>2012-02-25T12:49:07.518-08:00</updated><title type='text'>hey man your truly inspiring thanks</title><content type='html'>hey man your truly inspiring thanks</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/7506497038002467238'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/7506497038002467238'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1330202947518#c7506497038002467238' title=''/><author><name>Matt1652</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03897690008781131104</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1591505801"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="12:49 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-75655320822001647</id><published>2012-02-12T12:44:05.548-08:00</published><updated>2012-02-12T12:44:05.548-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Thank you for your blog.

Is NY your home town, or is it your destination?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/1182555993990931515'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/1182555993990931515'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1327652179908#c1182555993990931515' title=''/><author><name>Mobile Homemaker</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01514644458931963694</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-536784198"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="12:16 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-5549928022066227823</id><published>2012-01-26T20:14:42.059-08:00</published><updated>2012-01-26T20:14:42.059-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Can someone give me some advice?

I am new to the city and have no friends or family in the area. Likewise I have no car. It&amp;#39;s New York City, having a car is impractical and expensive, even if it doesn&amp;#39;t run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So since I haven&amp;#39;t heard a single good thing about shelters, I am wondering if anyone can advise me on where to stay? My homelessness will probably be for at least a half a year if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does anyone have suggestions short of a cardboard box or leaving the city?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/5549928022066227823'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/8187868285018909979/comments/default/5549928022066227823'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html?showComment=1327637682059#c5549928022066227823' title=''/><author><name>Rachel</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2011/03/current-status-of-blog.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8187868285018909979' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/8187868285018909979' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1247564572"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:14 PM"/></entry></feed>

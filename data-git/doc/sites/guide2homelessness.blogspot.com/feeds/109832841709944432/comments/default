I just can&amp;#39;t afford the rent any more, even if it is reasonable.  I already stretch our tiny income by not having pay tv or a smartphone or a car and being frugal about our energy consumption.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m not working the hours I used to and haven&amp;#39;t had even an inquiry into my ads for my housecleaning in months.  I lost a lot of clients a couple of years ago when I got injured and was out of work for 7 months and never really recovered the income I lost.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m 48 and no one seems to be hiring people my age, plus I&amp;#39;ve been living on less than $13,000 for years and haven&amp;#39;t gotten child support in over 5 years. My little bit of savings got eaten up by &amp;#39;involuntary time off&amp;#39; due to injury and illness and I am now living on $550 or so a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Martin County, FL by the water and still have a few cleaning clients left here.  I&amp;#39;ve decided to buy a sailboat with my tax refund and fix it up while living on it.  We&amp;#39;ll get a small storage space to keep some things but get rid of mostly everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to do this anyway next  summer when my teenager graduates high school and turns 18.  I want to travel and don&amp;#39;t have a lot of money so the sailboat cruising/liveaboard life appeals to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#39;s really sad when hard working people get lost in the system of greed. I&amp;#39;m glad to be fortunate enough to be able to do something about it that&amp;#39;s a reasonable alternative.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/1702100772668750888'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/1702100772668750888'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html?showComment=1389472958626#c1702100772668750888' title=''/><author><name>Jennifer Price</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15743938746672735780</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Jr3Hi70ao78/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFU/biOoc-_7is4/s512-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109832841709944432' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109832841709944432' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-993352839"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="12:42 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1186463895512459321</id><published>2013-12-22T02:52:20.966-08:00</published><updated>2013-12-22T02:52:20.966-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I SLEEP in my van, not live in it.  Big difference...</title><content type='html'>I SLEEP in my van, not live in it.  Big difference.  I was in the Army for 20 yrs sleeping in tents &amp;amp; eating out of Ravioli cans 3 times a day so for me van living is a piece of cake.  I make $2,500 a month so I have money to rent but why?  First off lets define what homeless is.  If you have a structure that has 4 walls, floor &amp;amp; ceiling then your NOT homeless.  My van is a structure.  Would you call a truck driver, soldier or a 65 year old retired couple living in an rv homeless?  No, I wouldnt.  Its all a state of mind really.  I have a membership at the 24 hr fitness center for only $10 a month which is where I shower twice a day.  Ive NEVER worked out but rather use the showers &amp;amp; free wifi instead.  When its hot out I simply go to the mall or Mc Donalds for the free wifi while sitting in the Food Court watching free Youtube movies all day.  For breakfast I just go to the motel / hotel, act like Im staying there &amp;amp; eat for free.  I always pick up an extra danish &amp;amp; fruit for my free lunch later.  Most of the time I sleep in the motel parking lot anyway. Ive never been caught but if I were I would simply say that I didnt think I could check in until 11 am.  Big deal $40 for a well deserved night anyway.  I live in Indiana but in Florida for the winter.  The weather here is GREAT!  Once it gets hot then I&amp;#39;ll go back up north.  Ive got solar panels on top of my van for electricity to run fans &amp;amp; a 12 volt coffee maker as well as my radio.  Ive NEVER paid for coffee or tea at Mc Donalds because I re-use my cups.  LOL!  Its my little way of sticking it to the man!  In the end its all about the money saved and nothing else.  I pay NO rent, very little for food &amp;amp; use very little gas because I only put 10 miles a day on my van.  No one here even knows I live in my van.  Im very clean / cut with a button up shirt &amp;amp; lap-top every morning.  Im a little different then most people living out of their van in that I dont scrounge, dumpster dive etc because I have money.  If I need something then I buy it period.  So for $7,200 in savings &amp;amp; $138,000 in 401K.  All from staying in my van for the past 9 yrs.  PS, I dont work because Im retired from the Army.  Im 51 now but retired at age 37.  In at 17 and out at 37 = 20 yrs.  </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/1186463895512459321'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/1186463895512459321'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html?showComment=1387709540966#c1186463895512459321' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109832841709944432' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109832841709944432' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1533098111"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="2:52 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-5327209986500368464</id><published>2013-01-29T21:05:02.865-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-29T21:05:02.865-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I noticed how many people writing on this blog are...</title><content type='html'>I noticed how many people writing on this blog are older; in fact most of us.  Despite years of working, I was never able to own a home and have been at the mercy of landlords too.  I retired last June; now I hae 1/2 the income I used to have.  Unfortunately, due to high stress job (which is why I retired) I have diabetes 2, recurring shingles and have to take Synthroid every day.  I had hoped to continue working past age 70, but it looks like I will have to find something else as an independent earner and I am grateful to have a pension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means I need some health care, must buy this medication and have to keep my life low key.  I want to have a business too; making things, selling things on line.  I got some good ideas from folks on this blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In childhood, we had been homeless several times, and in fact I was placed in an orphanage.  As a young adult I was homeless but managed to get through college and get employed.  Being homeless left me very anxious and driven.  I rented all my life and hoped to be able to own; but maybe its best not to own in this climate.  Either way it does not matter as I still can not afford a home.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get what you are trying to do for people when they become homeless.  Depression and despair do more to destroy people in difficult circumstances and you are helping people by changing their mental and psychological perspective to a positive view.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this blog is offering some positive constructive advice.  Thanks for offering it.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/5327209986500368464'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/5327209986500368464'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html?showComment=1359522302865#c5327209986500368464' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109832841709944432' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109832841709944432' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-822288357"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="9:05 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-5895910123232929943</id><published>2012-12-31T09:04:34.361-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-31T09:04:34.361-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I don&amp;#39;t get how you were getting work two days...</title><content type='html'> I don&amp;#39;t get how you were getting work two days of the week.

It is good to have skills in home repair and maintenance when on a fixed or low income. My little camper will be small and have only what I need. Nothing fancy, but built to last a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lived in manufactured campers from 8&amp;#39; slide-ins to a 20 footer since late 1995. When Mom had her stroke last year, I moved in with her to take care of her. She&amp;#39;s 92 and in failing health. Don&amp;#39;t see her around much longer. Her house is severely falling off the foundation, full of termites (up into the walls), and needs tearing down. Will use it for a storage place after she&amp;#39;s gone until I get rid of this stuff. Cutting the power and gas off to save some bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got rid of my old camper trailer. Feels strange living in a house again after living in campers for so long. Still sleeping in military surplus sleeping bags though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically not homeless, just financially challenged. My income is definitely below poverty level at the moment and in this economy, it will be a miracle if I ever get back up to what I use to make before being laid off in 2008. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my mid-fifties now and a woman living in Mississippi, the poorest state in the Union. Only jobs around here are minimum wage or not much better. But, it&amp;#39;s an income. I&amp;#39;m grateful. Buy only what you think you need and save for tags, taxes and truck maintenance. Keeping my old 12 year old truck up and running is a big concern for me. It&amp;#39;s the main reason why I save a part of my income each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blog has some great ideas on how to live well on less so please keep giving out ideas whether homeless, couch surfing, or financially challenged. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the poisoning of materialism and what it does to the soul.  After Mom passes, getting rid of a lot of old stuff and living lean for the rest of my life, God willing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 22, 2011 Jackson, MS</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/5720783353950502161'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/5720783353950502161'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html?showComment=1319331851336#c5720783353950502161' title=''/><author><name>Goldenrod</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11131511736597325131</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-loI1dcvlC8/SpPvK9qvbvI/AAAAAAAAAAM/pUp8gJwdXgE/S220/flag.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109832841709944432' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109832841709944432' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-742380310"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="6:04 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6794094643411809483</id><published>2011-10-02T23:23:41.034-07:00</published><updated>2011-10-02T23:23:41.034-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Legally and homeless are a contradiction.

Got cleaned out in 2000 by a cheating wife in a divorce and custody battle.  Been living with my elderly parents so I&amp;#39;d have the money to pay child supposrt.  Been unemployed for 2 years, UE ran out, and I&amp;#39; being hounded by State Treasury, IRS, FOC, and UE office has questions about a claim.  I&amp;#39;m in trouble not for what I did, but rather what I&amp;#39;m unable to do.  I&amp;#39;ve not had medical care in over 12 years, knees are shot, hips are going, elbows hurt, shoulders pop more than Rce Krispies in milk, and I&amp;#39;ve got tumor that&amp;#39;s sore to touch.  I&amp;#39;m hitting the road to get the only thing I value anymore:  Peace.  2 wool blankets, tarps, a tube tent, Kaadyne Combi water filter, knives, fishing gear, 12 MRE&amp;#39;s, fire starters, Water containers, Hatchets, saw blades, breakdown .22 rifle and 1000 rounds, and some knowledge and experience.  I&amp;#39;m going to the bush to get peace for my last days.  My needs are simple and few,  but I MUST get away from the artificial stresses in my life; I&amp;#39;ll live in peace,  till I die.

They&amp;#39;re solid techniques that work, but they aren&amp;#39;t sustainable, and they certainly aren&amp;#39;t moral. While I have avoided making moral judgments in this guide, I really don&amp;#39;t want to be detoured. This isn&amp;#39;t a guide to stealing from corporations or casinos or credit cards or others. This is a guide to sustainable homelessness, a survival guide to do homelessness right. That doesn&amp;#39;t include theft, or anything like theft. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daddy didn&amp;#39;t always teach me right from wrong, but when I was young he spotted me shoplifting a radio from a drugstore. Rather than bust me outright, he sat me down later and told me, &amp;quot;Son, you need to know something. They catch one hundred percent of thieves. People think they don&amp;#39;t, because they get away with it over and over before they get caught, but they only have to catch you once to completely tear down your life.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had a point.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/8760142286921600366'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/8760142286921600366'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html?showComment=1310014310866#c8760142286921600366' title=''/><author><name>Mobile Homemaker</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01514644458931963694</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109832841709944432' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109832841709944432' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-536784198"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="9:51 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7515821919885770302</id><published>2011-07-06T08:00:40.458-07:00</published><updated>2011-07-06T08:00:40.458-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I was never homeless but there were a few times af...</title><content type='html'>I was never homeless but there were a few times after college where I was floating on credit cards(underemployed and only paying rent and credit card payments in cash, everything else on credit).  Thankfully I had great credit at the time and high limits.  I always thought about what would happen if I knew that I only had 6 months or a year before my credit cards ran out and I would have been homeless.  I figured if I had to, I could pay for the things I would need way ahead of time and be ok.  I would&amp;#39;ve done all car maintenance I could&amp;#39;ve, paid for a year or two on a storage unit to keep my stuff, paid for a 24 hour gym membership in the area.  During this period where I was running on credit a lot, I was planning ahead by buying 100 or 50 dollar gift cards at the gas stations I used whenever I got gas, so in case I ran out of credit, I could afford gas for a few months or more.  I also bought ahead on all clothes I needed.  Luckily now I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about being homeless, but it&amp;#39;s good to know I have everything I need so even if I go underemployed again I don&amp;#39;t have to worry, and I have a plan in case I become homeless.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/7515821919885770302'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/7515821919885770302'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html?showComment=1309964440458#c7515821919885770302' title=''/><author><name>heydawghey</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00746109958453902469</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109832841709944432' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109832841709944432' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1632614922"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:00 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7389790996367103606</id><published>2011-06-13T17:00:38.783-07:00</published><updated>2011-06-13T17:00:38.783-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Thanks for all of the info.

I have some fear but also a sense of adventure in making this work.  I have my car, a gym membership and a job.  The job unfortunately does not give me the finances needed to rent.  I&amp;#39;m looking at a small storage unit to keep my extra belongs and clothes which will cost only about $25 a month.  I really appreciate everyones helpful info, but I&amp;#39;m also nervous about living a lie and making all of my friends and family think that I&amp;#39;m living the good life in south florida, but actually sleeping in my car.  I know I can make it work.  I refuse to deplete all of my resources just to live up to other peoples standards.

Living under a bridge, freezing to death, starving, not being able to brush one&amp;#39;s teeth, and facing the police are actually more like it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess you are saying that there is no way to make homelessness sustainable or survivable. You would prefer that homeless people live miserable, desperate, dirty, and brutal lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&amp;#39;d like me to agree with and reinforce the stereotypes? Yes? Well, friend anonymous, you can forget it. I&amp;#39;ve spent years of my life homeless. I&amp;#39;ve many times found myself down to my last dollar without a plan or a friend or a roof to my name. Yet, here I am writing this guide, a guide of optimism about how to live well in the humblest of circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m terribly sorry you don&amp;#39;t like it. Why don&amp;#39;t you go read something else?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/6093186313075152649'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109832841709944432/comments/default/6093186313075152649'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html?showComment=1299726051686#c6093186313075152649' title=''/><author><name>Mobile Homemaker</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01514644458931963694</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/advantages-of-homelessness.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109832841709944432' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109832841709944432' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-536784198"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="7:00 PM"/></entry></feed>

The way that you describe the run-in with the cops is spot-on. I had a similar experience in my go-van and in the City of Cupertino where there&amp;#39;s an ordinance against sleeping in one&amp;#39;s car. A just went to the City&amp;#39;s website to read the ordinance. Crazy! I emailed the sheriff for clarification. I did NOT get cited, though I asked the cop to do so (just to get things over with). I had to open the door because the pounding would have scared my toddler. The cop didn&amp;#39;t identify himself so I was pretty scared to open the door; finally, he did. I&amp;#39;m not homeless (I was getting an early start for a bike ride), but I believe this is a law that is used against the homeless, and it&amp;#39;s wrong. The cop did ask for ID, so make sure your ID isn&amp;#39;t expired. He was nice, and apologized for waking us - but I believe that&amp;#39;s only because he learned that we weren&amp;#39;t homeless. </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/7322972908915705167'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/7322972908915705167'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html?showComment=1397087060622#c7322972908915705167' title=''/><author><name>aakridge</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/10157148614740159306</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109822024939818471' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109822024939818471' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1801593077"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:44 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2928679887740814633</id><published>2014-04-09T16:25:20.005-07:00</published><updated>2014-04-09T16:25:20.005-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Thank you very much for this article.

The cop scenario you describe is spot-on. I didn&amp;#39;t avoid opening the van because the pounding was so loud, and I had my 2 1/2 year old with me (he rides in my bike trailor). Incredible that these law are on the books. I asked the officer to cite me. He wouldn&amp;#39;t. He apologized, but that&amp;#39;s because he figured out I wasn&amp;#39;t homeless. It&amp;#39;s a law to intimidate the homeless. Screw up! Also, he asked me for ID. If you become homeless, please have valid ID. Don&amp;#39;t let it expire.

Around 6 years ago I lived in a brand new red mustang for around a year, from that experience I bought a white dodge caravan and stayed in it for around 3 years. I was working and saving a lot of money. You have to blend in and you have to have a gym to shower in and also you have to look normal. Recently I just ran into hard times I am having trouble finding a job fortunately I have around 1200.00 in bank and own a 1994 Cadillac in great shape that runs great. I am 55 years old and a little concerned about working at a daily work daily pay place but I am going to do it and save all  I can. I actually own a 5th wheel that is worth around 7000.00 but I can&amp;#39;t afford the park anymore, I am going to store it till I get on my feet. I can&amp;#39;t wait till I am 62 to get my social security. I am really at the end of my rope when it comes to working for these 2 bit jobs that want to abuse you and take advantage of you, I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore and just hanging on. It is tough to live in a car or van but once you get it down it also has a nice feeling to it which I think is independence away from greedy society trying to take whatever they can from you. Good luck to all.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/6413462207371676499'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/6413462207371676499'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html?showComment=1391025250134#c6413462207371676499' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109822024939818471' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109822024939818471' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-170526820"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="11:54 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4945141277710079899</id><published>2013-12-06T09:07:34.544-08:00</published><updated>2013-12-06T09:07:34.544-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I&amp;#39;m of your mindset.

This very handy resource lists private sector jobs within the national park system. I highly recommend this book for anyone who can appreciate nature and doesn&amp;#39;t mind sharing a tent-cabin or dorm with another individual.  You can get enough money saved to move on and buy a car or whatever, with no major sacrifice.  You will meet other adventurers and travelers and learn much while enjoying the best of the u.s. that&amp;#39;s left imo. I got to live in Yosemite National Park for 9 months, bussing tables, for the cost of about 20 dollars a week, (20 yrs ago), including 3 meals a day.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I left that job behind, I have switched hats as a painter, a cook/chef, waiter, and occasionally jumped at other, more educational &amp;amp; adventurous gigs...and I have always had a van with curtains.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned to hang most everything off the sides to save room.  I learned to scout out in daylight, a parking option with high hedges to the east of the curb, or at least a tree where I could wake without cooking in the sun.  &lt;br /&gt;Seek out many places with this advantage, and rotate parking so that your cars presence doesn&amp;#39;t become a nuisance to the neighbors  who have too much time on their hands.  &lt;br /&gt;AAA is a wise investment for sure, as is some simple car-care/tune-up knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;Small holes in/or gaps around curtains allow for viewing the street scene before pulling out for the day.  My finding is that, if no one sees you at all--you&amp;#39;re likely to be best off.  Scout out the cleanest public restroom options, and do your best to find 24 hour options nearby. &lt;br /&gt;Eat early in the evening, not late night, and you will wake up much more relaxed in the morning and avoid the stress of hurrying to the loo.  &lt;br /&gt;Don&amp;#39;t reveal much to local homeless who seem to be always around the same old spots.  They may be friends too--but the association may get in the way of melding into the area if you wish to be there a while.

However, i am very knowledgeable about cold weather sleeping in general, so here are general principles for keeping warm really cold temps, if you are sleeping in the back of your car/van and not in the sea. (seats are quite insulated from convective heat loss, whereas the back of a vehicle/trunk area or floor of a minivan is NOT.) (and who can really sleep in a seat, especially for extended periods).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To comfortably and safely sleep in the back of a van or the back of a car/hatchback,   you will want a closed-cell foam camping pad (NOT an air mattress, though a combination air-foam pad like a therma-rest works, but a therma-rest is fragile compared to a simple foam roll) under you as insulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are dealing with really cold winter temps, 10F down to neg 10 F, you will want two foam pads under you, or two layers of foam pads, each made of two pads gorilla taped next to one another to make one very wide pad, then the layers topping each other to double up the depth of insulation/padding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For blankets you can use a down comforter, doubled up\, or a *continuous filament polyester* filled comforter and the thickish side.   That alone will carry you to 30F.  You want something that is light so that it doesn&amp;#39;t weigh you down.  Two comforters should carry you down to the -10 F to positivie 10F range, if doubled up (making four layers) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have one, a single-width or daybed width futon is probably better, but this is an uncommon item and takes up a lot of space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hoodie is excellent sleeping gear in the cold weather, as is a down vest over that. At really cold temps you may want a knit cap as well. Wear leggings or fleece bottoms. </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/3806266120601115742'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/3806266120601115742'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html?showComment=1364689829016#c3806266120601115742' title=''/><author><name>moocifer</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01325412523164314073</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6H-q9Nkhbw8/Thn1kmr_euI/AAAAAAAAAAQ/DzWcxaDLiuw/s220/highland-cow.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109822024939818471' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109822024939818471' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-294117334"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:30 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3078517931713809485</id><published>2013-03-03T09:50:55.569-08:00</published><updated>2013-03-03T09:50:55.569-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about living in my car to s...</title><content type='html'>I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about living in my car to save more money.

It was the police.  I didn&amp;#39;t sit up quickly cause I was hoping who ever it was would go away, but then I saw the lights flashing.  &amp;quot;Crap&amp;quot; I said to myself, &amp;quot;stay calm&amp;quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;They tapped on my window, asked me for my license, why I was there etc.  I told them the truth, but they said I could not stay there, it is &amp;quot;illegal to park here after the sun goes down&amp;quot;.  He was really nice and asked if I needed some assistance to get to a woman&amp;#39;s shelter or for counseling.  he jotted down some information on his card and gave it to me. It was a good experience, they showed they cared a little.  Just then the second cop that was walking around my car said something to the first cop.  I even had a big can of unopened beer on the floor of the back seat.  They told me that was also illegal, it has to be in the trunk (I had a truck, no trunk).  I explained that I was upset and I was going to drink it, but decided it was a bad idea, that I needed a clear head.  They just said, &amp;quot;good luck to you&amp;quot; and moved on.  They didn&amp;#39;t take my beer either!  &lt;br /&gt;My advice, just be sweet, it is much better to let them think they are awesome even if you think differently.  I&amp;#39;ve found it works with most people.  I know I was lucky!  After having heard some horrid stories from people and cops.  Too bad, they&amp;#39;d have us on their side more if they treated everyone with respect like these cops did.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/7951590222822276595'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/7951590222822276595'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html?showComment=1361035190363#c7951590222822276595' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109822024939818471' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109822024939818471' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1758887344"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="9:19 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7804993883236626639</id><published>2013-01-22T06:01:57.629-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-22T06:01:57.629-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Someone asked about what to do with their cat when...</title><content type='html'>Someone asked about what to do with their cat when living in their car. I&amp;#39;ve done this - it&amp;#39;s a lifestyle only for a very smart and unique kitty. Cats, unlike dogs, do not lose muscle because of living in tight spaces. The most important thing is to never allow your vehicle to become hot - that can kill any animal. If you park in a place next to sort of &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;park-like&amp;quot; areas (a small town rather than urban areas,) you can let your cat out during the day and she&amp;#39;ll be waiting for you if you have a routine schedule. But you must have a &amp;quot;street-smart&amp;quot; kitty to do this. (Rattle the food to call your cat rather than call it&amp;#39;s name.) People will merely think your cat is &amp;quot;feral&amp;quot; and ignore it, but have the cat micro-chipped in case it gets picked up by the local pound. Cats prevent mice damage in an RV. Prevent your cat from looking out the window by giving the kitty an &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; kitty carrier and rewarding her for hanging out in it where she can see out but someone can&amp;#39;t see her.&lt;br /&gt;If your cat is sweet and you aren&amp;#39;t good at training her for this lifestyle, find the kitty a place in a friend&amp;#39;s yard (or get her a job as a local &amp;quot;shop cat&amp;quot; at a business?) where you can tend, service and feed her as part of your routine.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/7804993883236626639'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/7804993883236626639'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html?showComment=1358863317629#c7804993883236626639' title=''/><author><name>Fran</name><uri>http://myhalfof.blogspot.com</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109822024939818471' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109822024939818471' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1267403550"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="6:01 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6339789755397074500</id><published>2013-01-14T23:03:44.539-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-14T23:03:44.539-08:00</updated><title type='text'>@Xtine: I&amp;#39;m afraid you&amp;#39;ll run into about a...</title><content type='html'>@Xtine: I&amp;#39;m afraid you&amp;#39;ll run into about a thousand codes preventing you from doing what you just described, and an acre is very small.

I&amp;#39;m wondering if there could be a solution like this:  I noticed a lot of cheap land for sale reasonably close to my city, maybe an hour away.  If you could purchase an acre or so (this is provided that you can get a loan to do so from a bank or credit union, a relative or perhaps use cash reserves), you could park your car, RV on this land and it would be yours.  The mortgage on this piece of land would only be what, between $100 or $200?  You can&amp;#39;t get kicked off of your own land, right?  And you could spend some of your time building yourself your own house, shelter or whatever.  Perhaps you could hook up with an old RV someone is getting rid of and spring to get it towed to your land.  Or a Yurt.  Something.  Again, this is for people with at least SOME resources or good credit- something.  But it would stop you from getting harrassed, and give you resources like natural materials and a place to set up a permanent campground.  I always loved that book and movie My Side Of The Mountain- in it, a kid runs away and builds a kind of tree shelter for himself on his grandfather&amp;#39;s land that is in his family&amp;#39;s name.  This could be the same concept.  It&amp;#39;s something to think about.  The reason I say an acre is to prevent there from being &amp;quot;neighborhood codes&amp;quot; that make it so that you have to build according to standard, and prevent you from living in an RV, Yurt, Tent, Log Cabin or other such arrangement because it would be an &amp;quot;eyesore&amp;quot; for the neighbors.  And you could build campfires with impunity- it&amp;#39;s YOUR land.  You would even have the right to build a fence and post &amp;quot;Keep Out&amp;quot; signs and so forth.  Then you could drive back and forth to the city to get work.  Nowadays we don&amp;#39;t really NEED all the convieniences of a house, we have our phones in our pockets, our laptops are our workstations and we can get the internet from a satelite with a plug in.  Everything we need is portable and provided, we just need to stay warm, be protected and take a bath or shower to have the ingredients of life.  With land, you could do this and pay so little.  I&amp;#39;ve been thinking of getting an acre and putting an unwanted RV on it just as an affordable getaway spot, so why couldn&amp;#39;t a homeless person use it as a permanent shelter?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/5243096149957219671'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/5243096149957219671'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html?showComment=1358162450825#c5243096149957219671' title=''/><author><name>Xtine</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12665223646138270790</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='22' height='32' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__YlFJugpxqA/Sv36r1VuG6I/AAAAAAAAAAY/pSWpX0vqb2c/S220/AbsAug.21.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109822024939818471' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109822024939818471' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1823063596"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="3:20 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3996171365961692736</id><published>2012-12-31T09:57:30.880-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-31T09:57:30.880-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Hey, what about sleeping during the day while loit...</title><content type='html'>Hey, what about sleeping during the day while loitering in public places?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can work just part of the day while I&amp;#39;m homeless.

As a matter of fact I found it looking for homeless shelter online but after reviewing those shelter are very stressful. I lost my job several weeks ago earning $3000 a month. My rent is $600 which is not paid yetand my room mate gave me until Dec 15 to leave. I am getting another Job in 2 weeks though paying $600 bi-weekly. Without exposing so much of my desperation I tried to ask for accommodation from friends and relatives but they all seemed reluctant. So the thought of sleeping in my pick-up truck kicked in. So my intention  is to get a gym&amp;#39;s membership and a storage unit. And then be rolling to Walmart every night and sleep in my truck. The though of doing so was scary but after reading the blog I am in.    </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/7202772704030284937'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/7202772704030284937'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html?showComment=1355316721648#c7202772704030284937' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109822024939818471' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109822024939818471' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1537036183"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:52 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7860070609459435553</id><published>2012-07-21T18:08:39.213-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-21T18:08:39.213-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I&amp;#39;ve been living in my car for the past month....</title><content type='html'>I&amp;#39;ve been living in my car for the past month. For the past three weeks, I parked my car at the local hospital garage. Big mistake. Security scared me awake after 2am and asked questions. They told me to move along. I then started parking at the local Home Depot for the past couple of days. It seemed fine until I saw a guy walking around the parking lot watching me pull in. Time to change places again. I&amp;#39;m going to try a new place tonight and see how that works out. A friend told me about the local pool being a cheaper option to the gym for showers. Right now, I do sponge baths at work and where I can find a single stall bathroom. The recent heatwave has made it virtually impossible to keep a cooler for food, but that will change soon.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/7860070609459435553'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/7860070609459435553'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html?showComment=1342919319213#c7860070609459435553' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109822024939818471' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109822024939818471' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-385971999"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="6:08 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7280745222242626127</id><published>2012-07-19T00:59:54.866-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-19T00:59:54.866-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I may have to resort to living in my car soon.

When I come to Seattle to visit family I sleep on the street in my minivan. The van is dark colored with tinted glass, and doesn&amp;#39;t attract attention. I tossed the middle and rear seats, and put in a comfortable sleeping futon. A sleeping bag and comforter keep me warm or cool as needed. For many months I&amp;#39;ve parked in a quiet residential side-street in an upscale community near Seattle. If residents notice my van they must assume it belongs to one of the other residents. Perfect! The van gives me great flexibility when I&amp;#39;m in town, and it&amp;#39;s stored at a Public Storage facility when I&amp;#39;m abroad. For hygiene and workouts I have a YMCA membership. This is by far the most economical way for me to stay in the Seattle area a few weeks or months at a time.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/4272567844731011327'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/4272567844731011327'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html?showComment=1341600266329#c4272567844731011327' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109822024939818471' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109822024939818471' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1804936682"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="11:44 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8069713268908862663</id><published>2012-04-23T18:13:25.741-07:00</published><updated>2012-04-23T18:13:25.741-07:00</updated><title type='text'>walmart policy lets rv&amp;#39;s park outside overnigh...</title><content type='html'>walmart policy lets rv&amp;#39;s park outside overnight , and in my experience cars also , I never had a problem , and since they dont call the cops , even if they see you there on patroll it is private property , and at worst they just ask if you are ok .

The first night is definitely the hardest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first night: It was raining like HELL!  I got locked out of my car, had to BREAK the window (accidentally) to get in.  I couldn&amp;#39;t ask the KOPS for help as I wasn&amp;#39;t very &amp;quot;legal&amp;quot;, re: automobile papers.&lt;br /&gt;So, I had to rig some rain protection IN THE RAIN, in my Dodge Caravan - as yet NOT ready to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEXT DAY, after duct taping the window, I was caught, at NIGHT, in the worst snow storm of the season! Had to drive WITH A FLAT TIRE a couple of miles to an auto repair place where I camped out that night - waking to about 6 inches of snow all around me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are doing better than most - you have A VEHICLE!&lt;br /&gt;DON&amp;#39;T go the &amp;quot;girlfriend&amp;quot; route.&lt;br /&gt;You are on the path of complete independence and FREEDOM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick it out until you are INDEPENDENT and FREE!!  You&amp;#39;ll be surprised at what you can make happen.  Having a girlfriend bail you out sounds nice but it keeps you WEAK! I do NOT envy or respect those who do this.  Ultimately, she won&amp;#39;t respect you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are actually a number of people who have real estate they&amp;#39;d rather not RENT, per se, but need someone to step in and keep the place for them.&lt;br /&gt;All kinds of situations - houses that are unfit for habitation, houses under going renovation, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lived in my car for TWO YEARS!  One day I was told (falsely) that they were going to start towing vehicles.  I called a friend and THAT EVENING, found myself in a LUXURY APARTMENT for two months - like dying and going to heaven! (He had the apt due to a fire in his home, he was back in the home but still had the apt for a few more months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I got a room here and there for a year and a half and now, recently, I met a person who let me stay in their un-inhabited home for a VERY reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;Now I live in an entire HOUSE - by myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAINLY I have to keep the heat bills and other utilities paid right now. He only wants $100 above the basic utilities when the weather eases up, but I plan to do him better than that, and told him so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really can get better.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/3116618611147691407'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109822024939818471/comments/default/3116618611147691407'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html?showComment=1326071682954#c3116618611147691407' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/importance-of-car-cover.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109822024939818471' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109822024939818471' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1672312446"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:14 PM"/></entry></feed>

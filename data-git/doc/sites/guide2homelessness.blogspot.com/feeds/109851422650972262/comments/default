As to the comments fromall sides about shelters;do you know that if you go to a shelter with your children, the first person you speak to is a social worker with a shief of paperwork for you to fill out-not to help you and your kids get a bed and hot shower- but an agrement that in return for their help you give custody of your children to the shelter. This is policy and you can go no further in the nice warm building until you do.once in the system you and your children can lose each other forever. No shelter, I repeat NO shelter is a safe option for families.

I am a Christian man, and I think it&amp;#39;s important to help those who find themselves in hard times (as we all do at times, to one degree or another), but I&amp;#39;ve considered volunteering at the faith-based homeless shelters and thought pretty much the same thing as you&amp;#39;re describing. It&amp;#39;s a simple matter of &amp;quot;actions speak louder than words&amp;quot;. Why would anyone believe there&amp;#39;s a God who loves them, when the man who&amp;#39;s supposed to be representing that God doesn&amp;#39;t even love them enough to see them as anything more than another person to convert? I mean, even Christ himself didn&amp;#39;t force people to sit through an our long sermon before he would consider healing them. He saw a persons need, healed their blindness or paralysis (or whatever), and left it at that... often saying little more than &amp;quot;go and tell no one&amp;quot;. Anyway, your insights on the best way to actually help the people who would normally go to homeless shelters would greatly be appreciated.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/2836769993250683278'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/2836769993250683278'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html?showComment=1318224094259#c2836769993250683278' title=''/><author><name>Steve</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109851422650972262' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109851422650972262' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1862721623"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:21 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8987808079888401776</id><published>2011-08-11T09:16:41.591-07:00</published><updated>2011-08-11T09:16:41.591-07:00</updated><title type='text'>dunno if anyone still keeps up with this blog. I j...</title><content type='html'>dunno if anyone still keeps up with this blog. I just discovered it. Im at the library now looking for information resources for tips on being homeless. ive discovered tons of neat tricks on my own, but have discovered a few here. I agree with some of it. disagree with others, and am downright offended by some of it. but over all a very good, informative narrative. I was kind of bothered by the judgmental nature of some of the posts tho. kind of got the feeling that some non homeless people here want to pat them selves on the back and cast verbal stones in an obscure, sneaky manner. let me just defend homeless people in general. We may not do things exactly as you do, or even as you may expect us to do. just because we have differing views or ways of doing things does not make us unapreciative or bad people just because we dont follow your plan to the letter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for example- the homeless family that didnt rush to the hotel at breakneck speed the instant you procured it for them, were not necesarrily unapreciative or not showing proper excitement or glee over the generous gift. It is very possible that they, like myself, follow a routine. believe it or not, a lot of homeless people are very organized. we like keeping to some sort of routine. it helps to stay sane. almost a &amp;quot;home-plus&amp;quot; person would do. before you go to bed, you most likely like to maybe watch the news, read for a half hour, brush your teeth, change into pajamas, ect. ect. ect. If i came along and paid 1/30th of your montly mortgage or rent, I wouldnt expect you to do back flips from me and immediatly run into the home, turn on the television, and lay in bed until &amp;quot;check out time&amp;quot;. you would most likely continue your normal routine after taking time to thank me for paying for a day of your montly rent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just some perspective. being homeless does not mean you are instantly part of some wild, anti-order, sub culture. we may do things a little different than you do, but we are all trying to accomplish the same long term things. like living a normal life. If you came along and rented me a hotel room, I would be very greatful and give you proper thanks. i would hope you wouldnt take it personal or be offended, though, if I didnt make a bee line for the room, lock myself in, and spend every second from that point ejoying 4 walls and television. I would more than likely continue my normal, pre bed time, routine.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml'

food and shelter for the nite....being overly religious has ruined alot of peoples experiences with christianity....i have a friend who sleeps on the river rather than spend the nite at the christian mission...it shouldnt be like that...it should be a place of peace a refuge people would want to run to....i also saw how the shelter did offer some very good programs for alcohol and drug rehabilition....and those that want to upgrade themselves can do so.  also using the word judgemental on christians who pull your covers or try to maybe wake you up from your own bull...is a cheap shot...and they dont need to bite into that at all....homeless people and moms have to start at a point also of respondsibility, direction,,discipline....i know i was one of the homeless woman at one time and i saw alot of stuff out there..i see both sides of the story and thats what you have to do to put the whole picture together...by the way my friend is still homeless by the river drinking...he still blames at times the religious mission...he could of tried a little harder himself and stuck it out and signed up for one of the programs,,his kids would of been happy for him instead of sad...they may try to use the word judgement  but pulling someones covers could help a stubborn person who blames everyone else....</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml'

But too many people are quick to judge the perceived judgemental or criticize the perceived critical...sounds like people are just too sensitive! (perhaps even you) Though we haven&amp;#39;t walked a mile in everyone&amp;#39;s shoes we are faulted for not speaking as if we have, though we mean only well. It&amp;#39;s this simple: I think it&amp;#39;s nice a woman tried to brighten the lives of homeless children and I&amp;#39;m sure she wouldn&amp;#39;t let her kids live that way; sitting through a sermon to get a meal or bed is barter; the words &amp;quot;insane&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;retard&amp;quot; mean different things to different people...they aren&amp;#39;t bad in themselves (They worked for years until the &amp;quot;educated&amp;quot; proliferated). That said, I&amp;#39;m glad someone brought up Buddhism and wandering. I&amp;#39;ve heard that many Hindus leave behind their possessions and even family late in life and go on a spiritual journey of homelessness and begging. These lessons are largely lost on the western capitalist...not that I&amp;#39;m being critical,mind you.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/6069105773313445555'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/6069105773313445555'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html?showComment=1282686189972#c6069105773313445555' title=''/><author><name>Mathias</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03244785594436568154</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109851422650972262' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109851422650972262' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1697790184"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="2:43 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-5091142537940804280</id><published>2010-05-20T17:40:31.785-07:00</published><updated>2010-05-20T17:40:31.785-07:00</updated><title type='text'>There is a distance between insanity and mental il...</title><content type='html'>There is a distance between insanity and mental illness. Insanity is a condition of chaos, it can attach to a mind, an environment, or a happening. I understand that I touched upon a sensitivity for you, and for that I apologize. I was responding to a frequent criticism of the blog that my advice can only be put into practice by &amp;quot;competent&amp;quot; individuals, who &amp;quot;obviously&amp;quot; would not be homeless. The reality is that everyone, in every condition and degree of mental and physical health, faces some risk of homelessness. This blog is not devoted to saving the most pathetic, but to helping those with some capacity to help themselves. Your comment does not lead me to believe that my blog leaves you out.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/5091142537940804280'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/5091142537940804280'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html?showComment=1274402431785#c5091142537940804280' title=''/><author><name>Mobile Homemaker</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01514644458931963694</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109851422650972262' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109851422650972262' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-536784198"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:40 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6718421214913612012</id><published>2010-05-20T13:37:34.810-07:00</published><updated>2010-05-20T13:37:34.810-07:00</updated><title type='text'>It&amp;#39;s just too bad that you&amp;#39;d use the word ...</title><content type='html'>It&amp;#39;s just too bad that you&amp;#39;d use the word &amp;quot;insane&amp;quot; to describe people with mental illness, which just happen to make up the majority of homeless individuals. Not your battle I guess, you seem more interested convincing people you were &amp;quot;homeless&amp;quot; as apposed to a &amp;quot;bum.&amp;quot; However, stigma is stigma. I&amp;#39;m bipolar, I&amp;#39;ve been homeless twice. I also put myself through full time college while working two 20hr/wk jobs. I found it interesting that you don&amp;#39;t see any connections between having a bipolar mother, a father who committed suicide, and how proud you are of your history of getting all A&amp;#39;s and working multiple jobs (which is how my hypomania manifested itself-highly motivated, taking on many things, and needing little sleep.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, this blog is still a great service. There are a lot of good tips here and I&amp;#39;m an avid reader (libraries provide great free entertainment) and look forward to your book. However, you mentioning that being a homeless woman was the most stigmatized individual you could find yourself being. You&amp;#39;re wrong. Being an &amp;quot;insane&amp;quot; homeless woman is obviously worse.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/6718421214913612012'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/6718421214913612012'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html?showComment=1274387854810#c6718421214913612012' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109851422650972262' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109851422650972262' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-2085332202"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="1:37 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6864989910296299084</id><published>2010-05-01T10:10:32.830-07:00</published><updated>2010-05-01T10:10:32.830-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I have been homeless before, and can flat out say ...</title><content type='html'>I have been homeless before, and can flat out say that the most judgemental people I met were the leaders of Christian charities. I got more change given to me by neighbors as poor as me so I could do laundry, and the bottle guy (collected bottles and cans) started showing up every few days with a gallon of milk for my kids he had on his own decided to do. I know there are angels among us...there have too many incidents that have taken place in my life to be called mere serendipity...and I don&amp;#39;t use the word lightly, but I would say the word miracle fits h ere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has got to be one of the most frustrating ways of becoming homeless is when you left a bad boyfriend or roomate and your credit isn&amp;#39;t the best so you are told you will need not just first month and deposit but last months too. This is the MAIN reason why families spend so much time in the car...if they spend the money on cheap motels they get sucked into that trap and end up living that way for up to years at a time. Even camping is not allowed for any real length of time. It&amp;#39;s great to find a place with flushing toilets and hot showers and pay for a campsite..but in California you are only allowed to spend 14 nights at a time in any California campsite. That&amp;#39;s right, when you have to leave the campsite you have been staying at, you are not allowed to camp at any local or state campsite until 14days are up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if we are going to help the homeless we need to stop heaping all the ills of the world on their heads and go ahead and make some exceptions during these hard times. If a family could camp out for three months then not only would the move in requirements be met because there would have been enough time to save up the money needed, but also there would even be a little extra to get needed household items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something where a thrift store can come in handy too. Why not give vouchers that allow the recipient to go to the thrift store (be it Salvation ARmy or Goodwill etc)and use the vouchers to get household itesm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if people REALLY want to know how to help, how about getting to know just 1 person, or 1 family and focus on that. You can really make a difference in someone&amp;#39;s life. I know when I needed it most, a total stranger co-signed for a place for me that was getting ready to turn me down even though I had cash on hand because my credit wasn&amp;#39;t good, but then he said he had a cosigner but I couldn&amp;#39;t know who it was..I still don&amp;#39;t know to this day, but God bless that person, and God bless all who do what they can to help.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/6864989910296299084'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/6864989910296299084'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html?showComment=1272733832830#c6864989910296299084' title=''/><author><name>medicvet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02704294685552906522</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109851422650972262' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109851422650972262' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-938617939"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:10 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7059738804917977874</id><published>2010-02-22T11:55:48.257-08:00</published><updated>2010-02-22T11:55:48.257-08:00</updated><title type='text'>As a caseworker for almost 20 years I can whole he...</title><content type='html'>As a caseworker for almost 20 years I can whole heartedly appreciate your comments about faith-based initiatives.  I&amp;#39;ve lived through this transfer of public funds from city, county and state programs to churches and it is not a good thing.  I work with homeless families and what is done with homeless children in order to ensure the church&amp;#39;s volunteers have a &amp;quot;positive experience&amp;quot; is not right.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also see the waste of monies going to craft making projects to produce &amp;quot;I Love Jesus&amp;quot; paraphernalia and other such things.  The church&amp;#39;s agenda is everywhere and in every program they host.  That money could buy school supplies or new clothes for the children, but is instead wasted on furthering their dogma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&amp;#39;ve seen churches take the money, then refuse to provide services for anyone who was not &amp;quot;a member of their church&amp;quot;.  In other words, pagans, muslims, Jews, Catholics and the non-religious were left without services.  Social services should be provided equally to everyone regardless of religious belief, especially when they are funded with federal tax dollars.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your first hand experience.  It&amp;#39;s at least nice to know I&amp;#39;m not the only one who sees this.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/7059738804917977874'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/7059738804917977874'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html?showComment=1266868548257#c7059738804917977874' title=''/><author><name>Kellen</name><uri>http://www.kellevision.com/homeless</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109851422650972262' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109851422650972262' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1145770462"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="11:55 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3700982943618218379</id><published>2010-02-18T10:27:14.861-08:00</published><updated>2010-02-18T10:27:14.861-08:00</updated><title type='text'>hi my name is Dirk i&amp;#39;m homeless. this life mig...</title><content type='html'>hi my name is Dirk i&amp;#39;m homeless. this life might suck, well ok! it&amp;#39;s does. but at the moment it&amp;#39;s all i have. some people dont realize being homeless sometimes it&amp;#39;s not a choice. but how you end up. yes there&amp;#39;s alot of drugs &amp;#39; and drunks. but that&amp;#39;s not what or should i say why that happened to them,or me.&lt;br /&gt;everyone has a story, maybe you should try to talk to them sometime,you never know you might learn that there not so bad!!!!!!!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/3700982943618218379'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/3700982943618218379'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html?showComment=1266517634861#c3700982943618218379' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109851422650972262' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109851422650972262' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1350635196"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:27 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7537070536211686454</id><published>2009-11-04T19:19:39.517-08:00</published><updated>2009-11-04T19:19:39.517-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Hi Gez,&#xa;&#xa;I don&amp;#39;t think I see how that is a bet...</title><content type='html'>Hi Gez,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I see how that is a better solution.

I work with people who are &amp;#39;homeless&amp;#39;, most have mental illness or addictions and probably couch surf rather than stay in shelters. When I care for somebody in the loading dock where they sleep in a cardboard box that hides their baby, I&amp;#39;m not thinking they should be a better mother, I&amp;#39;m thinkng how to help them to be safe. I&amp;#39;m thinking about what they need to survive. What they don&amp;#39;t need is a shelter.  What they do need is respect, food, medical care and a blanket.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m learning about my own judgementalness, arrogance and lack of compassion every day.

I&amp;#39;m grateful though, for the lessons and hope that my work will at least contribute to the rippling wave of healing that we all seem to be part of in this blog.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/6697808146499429192'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/6697808146499429192'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html?showComment=1257367956307#c6697808146499429192' title=''/><author><name>Cyrius</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109851422650972262' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109851422650972262' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1919170636"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="12:52 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2990098542979931713</id><published>2009-10-17T13:49:51.577-07:00</published><updated>2009-10-17T13:49:51.577-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Ok, but your are bringing your activism to someone...</title><content type='html'>Ok, but your are bringing your activism to someone who is essentially on the same side.

If they are on the ball enough and lucid enough to get to a computer and to get here to read this blog, then they can be helped.  If they are delusional they will never make it this far anyways.  You do not have to address their illness, just their homelessness.  They should be as welcome as anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of what you write about is useful and helpful, but it is not hard to grasp, just new ideas or things people have not considered.  Those who cannot grasp your techniques are more likely mentally slow than mentally ill but even if they cannot get everything they can get some things.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad thing is that in this country the ranks of the homeless are far more represented by the mentally ill and by our military veterans than just regular people who are down on their luck.  Yet all of them can benefit from your homeless experiences as well as those who comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keep up the good work.  I am particularly sensitive to the plight of the mentally ill since my goddaughter who just turned 18 was diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier this year and is working hard just to finish high school.  I know that because of this in her life she will face difficulty in finding a job and a place to live and will face discrimination because of her illness.  I would just hate to think that she would face discrimination at a place which has good tips for helping the homeless to survive and thrive as best they can.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/9168075094657857168'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109851422650972262/comments/default/9168075094657857168'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html?showComment=1255812037575#c9168075094657857168' title=''/><author><name>elocs</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09987005701778934866</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/shelters-are-for-someone-else-part-1.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109851422650972262' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109851422650972262' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1147730142"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="1:40 PM"/></entry></feed>

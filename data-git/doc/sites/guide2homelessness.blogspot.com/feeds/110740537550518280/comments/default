A few quick comments--as I am currently using the library computer. lol-- Using the library computer is fine when it&amp;#39;s not packed, early morning-late evening. A laptop seems nice, but for me personally, having one negates any benefit of me being &amp;quot;homeless.&amp;quot; That is, for me it has been a spiritual experience, one of inner-reflection. Having a laptop is wonderful, but it&amp;#39;s just being at home, without a home....if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the army blanket tip. I&amp;#39;ll be spending my first winter here in NY and the cold weather is daunting. Will do that. As was said, I don&amp;#39;t see how the itchiness would be a factor, unless some psycho was sleeping in the nude underneath it. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As MH said, shelters are a no-no---unless you like bed bugs, foul smell, and getting robbed. It&amp;#39;s not the Holiday Inn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get along fine in a huge park in Brooklyn over night. It&amp;#39;s full of cops but they turn the other way with most local homeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with the dreadlocks. I must also say, while there are definitely times I wish I had my car, I have been very happy without it. I don&amp;#39;t miss the expense of gas, tags, insurance, tickets, fender benders etc.....and it is the number one way to get harassed by police. I travel very well, under the radar, on my bike----I just can&amp;#39;t sleep in it, damn. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as products I can&amp;#39;t do without, and sorry if they are repeats because I didn&amp;#39;t have the time to make it all the way through the comments, but I&amp;#39;d have to say Antibacterial Wipes, Listerine, paper towels and a spray bottle.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather, too hot, too cold, and personal hygiene are the main points for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, let me reiterate to those who &amp;quot;feel guilty&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;feel bad&amp;quot; -- contrary to what is portrayed, being &amp;quot;homeless&amp;quot; is not something to pity. In fact, many &amp;quot;homeless&amp;quot; people are not interested in finding a place to live, though some certainly are. &lt;br /&gt;I think the biggest &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; is the fact that people don&amp;#39;t want them around. Basically, society doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone outside of their boundaries. It&amp;#39;s a small, limiting area indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks again</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/2554828002102234475'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/2554828002102234475'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?showComment=1410997988760#c2554828002102234475' title=''/><author><name>Shonn Frank</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08067525046766394573</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Umq2ECOkj0s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACQ/a4HpeRUVzmc/s512-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110740537550518280' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110740537550518280' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1994949992"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:53 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-5822666215069365074</id><published>2014-03-11T04:46:37.293-07:00</published><updated>2014-03-11T04:46:37.293-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Cooking: You can make a solar oven out of cardboar...</title><content type='html'>Cooking: You can make a solar oven out of cardboard boxes, tape and black tempra paint (may also need an oven bag), and use the box for storage when it isn&amp;#39;t in use.

I store it in a tupperware container and mix a small amount with a dab of water on the lid to make a toothpaste. It can also be placed in a sock and put in shoes to remove odors.

Thievery was a problem so I kept everything in a surplus military &amp;quot;A3&amp;quot; bag: a fabric box of about 12&amp;quot;x20&amp;quot;x24&amp;quot; with two strap handles.  I could put everything I didnt want stolen in that and bungee it to my bike rack.  It&amp;#39;d hold a LOT.

Chilly but it works.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/161491875682196116'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/161491875682196116'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?showComment=1363923756581#c161491875682196116' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110740537550518280' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110740537550518280' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1511499232"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:42 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-818928866682042313</id><published>2012-12-12T22:53:26.655-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-12T22:53:26.655-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I&amp;#39;m surprised noone has mentioned this yet!!.....</title><content type='html'>I&amp;#39;m surprised noone has mentioned this yet!!....I just finished a 6 month sojourn, homeless in SW Oregon, Eureka, SF/Marin County, Monterey county, Big Sur, and Morro Bay: State parks are where it&amp;#39;s at! -Showers. Water. Toilets....Camp in the bushes near state park campgrounds and keep a low profile-no one will ever know you&amp;#39;re not a legitimate (paying) camper...Blend in. Stay close to bus routes: Homeless agencies will give you bus passes so you can go into towns to resupply. State park campgrounds are safe-no cops, and the high camping fees keep ruffians out. &lt;br /&gt;I use a $20 Wenzel tan low profile pup tent: just enough room for one person and some stuff. Raccoons are attracted to state park campsites, and sometimes bears, so keep your food IN your tent with you. Don&amp;#39;t leave dirty cookware/dinnerware outside to attract scavengers...Burn your garbage/food scraps. Newspaper is the BEST insulation: keep it dry, line your clothes with it and line your blankets/bag with it, too. Maintain hope; never succumb to panic or despair....Best way to maintain good morale is to keep occupied, and devise strategies to make your existence palatable or even pleasurable. I sought out natural beauty; seasides, historic areas (Golden Gate bridge on Marin side is excellent for stealth campers) Stay where the rich camp and you will never have to worry about getting &amp;quot;rolled&amp;quot; in the middle of the night by aggressive druggies or criminals who prey on the homeless. I ate fine breakfasts at Hampton Inn and other 2-3 star hotels which have free continental breakfasts. You can stock up on coffee, tea, pastries, napkins, plasticware at these cont. bfasts. Just look presentable: the minimum wage front desk agent will never know you&amp;#39;re not a hotel guest. You can cruise the maid&amp;#39;s carts for shampoo, soap, and towels. And maybe even sneak into a room opened for cleaning, lock the door, and take a quick shower. Maybe tell the maid you forgot some things in &amp;#39;your&amp;#39; room first, so she won&amp;#39;t call security.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/818928866682042313'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/818928866682042313'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?showComment=1355381606655#c818928866682042313' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110740537550518280' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110740537550518280' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1935560414"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:53 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4484354561641806538</id><published>2012-03-19T09:48:21.257-07:00</published><updated>2012-03-19T09:48:21.257-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Tracfone...I know disposable phones have been said...</title><content type='html'>Tracfone...I know disposable phones have been said but as this is an older blog i wanted to say my Tracfone has been a 10 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;Newer one now come with triple minutes for life. about 6 cents a min , 2 cent to send or receive a text.&lt;br /&gt;It costs me $0.00 when I&amp;#39;m not using it, no hidden fees, no minutes that vanish if you don&amp;#39;t use them.&lt;br /&gt;If I&amp;#39;m broke I buy a $20 card to get by.&lt;br /&gt;When I get paid, I buy a $80, 450 min card (gives me 1500 min) and I&amp;#39;m set for 6 months&lt;br /&gt;It works all across the country.&lt;br /&gt;Not a true smart phone but will surf the web on limited sites.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/4484354561641806538'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/4484354561641806538'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?showComment=1332175701257#c4484354561641806538' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110740537550518280' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110740537550518280' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-155272856"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="9:48 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3671499664277538835</id><published>2012-03-10T12:06:09.855-08:00</published><updated>2012-03-10T12:06:09.855-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Love this site, I&amp;#39;ve been reading for a couple...</title><content type='html'>Love this site, I&amp;#39;ve been reading for a couple of hours now.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to be living in my small SUV in just a few weeks.

They are outstanding for warmth (even used in Siberia).  You can find them sometimes at Goodwill or Salvation Army; they’re usually worn along the edges and cheap.  They’re usually black, with silky tight black wool curls.   Just be sure to review internet articles for how to distinguish real Persian lamb from fake.  They don’t itch at all.  They are even warmer than wool fabric, and are water repellant, plus they wick moisture away.  You can put a cold drink under one in summer, and hours later it will still be cold.  Same with something hot.   You would have to cut them up (they’re easy to cut) and sew or pin them with blanket pins to make a blanket or sleeping bag.  You could even use fabric glue and attach the pieces to another blanket.  Persian lamb is very heavy—not something you would want to carry around.  If you had two layers of Persian lamb, it would be as warm as any subzero sleeping bag.  I know some will object that this is fur, but buying vintage fur is not causing any new harm to any animal, and it is not going to influence the fashion industry if you’re using it as a blanket.  It’s super soft and comfortable, and it doesn’t look feminine or like fur.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/5697614112198942535'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/5697614112198942535'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?showComment=1321035235065#c5697614112198942535' title=''/><author><name>Cindy</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09994808657851811358</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110740537550518280' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110740537550518280' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1871297132"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:13 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6671932915791381418</id><published>2011-08-15T15:36:34.731-07:00</published><updated>2011-08-15T15:36:34.731-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Long list of comments here, so people have probabl...</title><content type='html'>Long list of comments here, so people have probably already left satisfactory explanations, but I have used those itchy wool military blankets, and even just a single thin sheet between ones self and the blanket will suffice to solve the itchiness problem.  And of course, in the case of extreme cold, or extreme sleep deprivation, one will get over the itchiness.  It might be worth mentioning that while these blankets are pretty efficient for their size and weight and a good color for concealment in general, more heat is lost through the head than anywhere else.  wearing something with a hood or getting ahold of a ski mask or balaclava or beanie/watchcap and keeping the blankets up around ones neck can make all the differance in staying warm.  &lt;br /&gt;     It may be overly obvious, but another thing to remember is, wrap your bedding around yourself.  any space between your body and the bedding requires that your body sheds heat to warm it.  if you do use a sleeping bag and there is space between your feet and the bottom, stuff it with your clothes.  offhand, there is the risk of having to be ready to move if something unexpected happens, but in a sleeping bag, sleeping naked is more heat efficient, since wearing clothes slows your body heat from filling the dead air space between your clothes and the sleeping bag.  &lt;br /&gt;     and btw, great blog here.  as many others have said, it&amp;#39;s great to have this knowledge, even if it&amp;#39;s only &amp;#39;just in case&amp;#39;.  it&amp;#39;s great that you are helping people to shrug off some of the fear and stress that society saddles people with.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/6671932915791381418'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/6671932915791381418'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?showComment=1313447794731#c6671932915791381418' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110740537550518280' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110740537550518280' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1657806033"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="3:36 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-9182752706353901597</id><published>2011-07-30T19:40:10.914-07:00</published><updated>2011-07-30T19:40:10.914-07:00</updated><title type='text'>As far as food -

This will provide a bit more storage space as well as keep clothes wrinkle-free for job interviews, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Tint your windows for privacy; tinting works better than using barriers (blankets etc.) because it enables you to see out while others cannot see in. This could be helpful when trying to live unnoticed. Barriers also attract attention and advertise what you are doing, while tinted windows are very common on many cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you wear contact lenses you will need a disinfectant for your hands. Better yet, wear glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sleeping will likely be a challenge at first because there is a good chance that your vehicle is not large enough for you to fully stretch out your body. Find a position where you can comfortably sleep with your legs bent or against your chest. Alternatively, you can try sitting up in the back seat and propping a pillow against the wall of the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Get an automobile association membership. This will help you if you drain your battery, or break down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure you have vehicle documentation and insurance. Without them, your problems will increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Personal safety should always be your number-one priority. Knives used for food preparation and tire irons can be used as weapons. You may want to learn your state&amp;#39;s gun laws and purchase a handgun or other firearm if you do not already own one. Criminals seek out people who appear vulnerable, or travel alone. Sometimes the sound of a cocked gun will be sufficient enough to deter a potential mugger. However, be aware that if police become aware that you have a gun, they may shoot you for possessing a weapon. Police generally do not regard homeless people well and there has been many unfortunate cases of shootings of homeless people (even unarmed ones) by police.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you are spending the night in your car and you have been drinking alcohol, do not have the keys in the ignition, If it is winter and you need to run the car for heat, move over to the passenger or back seat. Otherwise, you could get a DUI/DWI just for being in your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The garbage truck or other neighborhood noises can wake you up. Consider earplugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pay attention to your instincts. If a parking spot feels weird for any reason, find yourself a new one.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/1781347803327080402'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/1781347803327080402'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?showComment=1308820787311#c1781347803327080402' title=''/><author><name>cHACKo</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110740537550518280' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110740537550518280' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1059406911"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="2:19 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-5984196336659684856</id><published>2011-06-23T02:10:07.346-07:00</published><updated>2011-06-23T02:10:07.346-07:00</updated><title type='text'>-Avoid driving the car.

A danger is that they may write a report about you to a government office in the hope that they&amp;#39;ll cancel your license.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Never sleep in the driver seat if you can avoid it. Your body will quickly associate that seat with sleeping, creating risks when you are driving - especially when you&amp;#39;re tired. Recline the passenger seat or lie down in the back if there is room.&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;-If you are sleeping in the car on a regular basis, do as few other things in the car as possible. Don&amp;#39;t eat, read, or anything else that will cause you to spend more time than necessary in the car. The more time you spend in it, the more smells will accumulate.&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;-If you use a car cover, never run the car or smoke while it is on. You could easily suffocate or get carbon monoxide poisoning. Also, do not use it on a warm day without adequate ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;-Be careful who you tell about your living in a car. If they&amp;#39;re not likely to provide assistance, then don&amp;#39;t bother, because you might end up endangering yourself.&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;-Be aware that having a gun in the car carries its risks. If you are startled awake and point the gun at the wrong person (i.e. a cop tapping on the window), you can wind up being shot yourself.&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;-Don&amp;#39;t drink alcohol. Don&amp;#39;t even bring any alcohol into your car. If cops find you with alcohol in your blood or in your car, you could get in serious trouble, even if you&amp;#39;re not driving at the time.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/5984196336659684856'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/5984196336659684856'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?showComment=1308820207346#c5984196336659684856' title=''/><author><name>cHACKo</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110740537550518280' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110740537550518280' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1059406911"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="2:10 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1343946784773866547</id><published>2011-06-13T15:24:20.457-07:00</published><updated>2011-06-13T15:24:20.457-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Agreed a bike is a huge help for mobility if one d...</title><content type='html'>Agreed a bike is a huge help for mobility if one does not have a car, but it does complicate sleeping.

If your moving state to state and want to explore you can find a local cycling club online and find organized rides, there is a whole culture of long distance cycling, like RV&amp;#39;ing</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/779976537700011265'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/779976537700011265'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?showComment=1307848354214#c779976537700011265' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110740537550518280' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110740537550518280' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-878626594"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:12 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-285452078984609344</id><published>2011-06-01T10:13:42.673-07:00</published><updated>2011-06-01T10:13:42.673-07:00</updated><title type='text'>The mylar emergency blankets are great for staying...</title><content type='html'>The mylar emergency blankets are great for staying very warm at night. As a &amp;#39;camper&amp;#39; who uses a small, uninsulated utility trailer as shelter, I create a tent of one of the blankets that cover all of the part of me that isn&amp;#39;t under the covers. The mylar blankets are stiff enough that they can be puffed up well above your face so that you don&amp;#39;t feel you will suffocate yourself. You&amp;#39;ll have a nice bubble of warmth all around your upper body and head, that is very comfortable. They can be purchased for under $3./pc. in camping sections at big name stores. You can purchase them in bulk from a medical supply place in Brooklyn, NY. Can&amp;#39;t remember name, though (B&amp;amp;J?). Cost $.75 each plus shipping. It&amp;#39;s worth it to buy 25. It&amp;#39;ll last a couple of years, at least, as each one can be used for quite a while. After that they can be used to create a privacy curtain inside your vehicle, it continues to add some warmth, and you can see through them somewhat, if there&amp;#39;s light on the outside.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/285452078984609344'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110740537550518280/comments/default/285452078984609344'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?showComment=1306948422673#c285452078984609344' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110740537550518280' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110740537550518280' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1824871503"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:13 AM"/></entry></feed>

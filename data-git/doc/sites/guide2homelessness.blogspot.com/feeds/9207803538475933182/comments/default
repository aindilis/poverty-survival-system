Of course there are many who understand how life can be and will have different thoughts on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is highly commendable to be proud you were resourceful when you were flat on your face or for helping people deal with a problem you were faced with. No matter what life has dealt you, if you have information that can help someone who may be going through a similar thing then it is far more decent than a millionaire who writes a big check to charity with the cameras rolling...

It is most hurtful when those who disapprove are people who (are supposed to) love you - and I am sorry you have had to experience that.

I don&amp;#39;t know your ...</title><content type='html'>Hello, dear unknown friend. I don&amp;#39;t know your name, but I&amp;#39;m gonna call you a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I have stumbled across your blog, by a mistake maybe, and I have read some of your articles.I appreciate your effort to take time and share your knowledge with others. &lt;br /&gt;The things you write about, are of great value because you lived them, and you know how it feels, and that makes you a valuable person.&lt;br /&gt;I see the majority of them are written about 10 years ago. Ain&amp;#39;t it weird how 10 years went by? &lt;br /&gt;It seems that you miss that period, and reading further on, you also describe some of the situations in your life at the moment, or at the moment you wrote about them.&lt;br /&gt;I guess that you miss the freedom you had when you were homeless, because now when you have an union job, you have a routine, you don&amp;#39;t feel the need to don&amp;#39;t look like a homeless, you start to neglect yourself, you get sunburns, and so on. Maybe that&amp;#39;s the effect of not fighting anymore, of comfort, of routine. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe although you had to fight everyday being homeless, you felt more alive then, than you do now. &lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think you owe nothing to nobody on this planet, not to your father who wants to edit your blog, not to your family who can&amp;#39;t accept what you were, not to your friends that maybe make fun of you. Not even to your children.&lt;br /&gt;You were born free, and you should be free from people who can&amp;#39;t accept what you are. And if that means being alone, you should accept it, and get used to if, if you haven&amp;#39;t done that already.&lt;br /&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need these people. And you don&amp;#39;t need to be affected by those who are against you, like the anti-atheists. Those who never been through what you been, cannot understand, and cannot accept. Fuck their opinions. &lt;br /&gt;You should leave and be free. You said your wife left you, and I don&amp;#39;t know how this works in USA cause I&amp;#39;m not from USA, maybe you have to pay alimony I guess.&lt;br /&gt;But if that makes you feel chained, I remind you that you owe nothing to nobody. It&amp;#39;s not worth it to live in the state of nostalgia. That&amp;#39;s like masturbating instead of having sex.&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the life you had before, you can do it again. And you don&amp;#39;t need to do it in the USA. You can travel. You can travel to Europe. &lt;br /&gt;There are different countries in Europe where you could live again, maybe as a homeless in the beginning, and later on, maybe in a new family where you will feel loved, and feel human again. This world is more than what routine teaches you that it is. Someone who hasn&amp;#39;t traveled is like someone who reads only a page of an entire book.&lt;br /&gt;I think you&amp;#39;ll find in other countries that laws are different, that you&amp;#39;re not forbidden to sleep, for instance. &lt;br /&gt;As you were writing this blog 10 years ago, you were thirty and something, now it&amp;#39;s written in your profile that you&amp;#39;re forty and something.&lt;br /&gt;Soon you gonna be fifty and something. Time will pass by. Your life isn&amp;#39;t over yet, you don&amp;#39;t need to settle for this situation. Life isn&amp;#39;t about working and routines. It&amp;#39;s about struggle for your own, feeling alive, and being happy. You&amp;#39;re still young. &lt;br /&gt;As it says in that movie  &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s only after we lost everything, that we&amp;#39;re free to do anything&amp;quot;, what do you have?&lt;br /&gt;You had nothing before, except a car and some things. Maybe now you have an apartment. You should sell everything. Sell the life you&amp;#39;re living.&lt;br /&gt;Go to another country. Get lost, lose your track, lose your papers, start a new life. Visit new places, meet new people, feel new feelings. &lt;br /&gt;You are a valuable man, and what you been through, should mean something to you, you shouldn&amp;#39;t wait and die, you shouldn&amp;#39;t go down, not in this way.&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want my message to sound offensive, if it does, please ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t want a valuable man&amp;#39;s spirit to be amputated. Don&amp;#39;t allow that to happen to yourself. Have some pride for your ego, and that will keep your alive, more alive than these people who surround you will ever be.&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect, from Marco.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/9207803538475933182/comments/default/1520834790593736374'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/9207803538475933182/comments/default/1520834790593736374'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2012/05/problem-of-coming-out-is-same-no-matter.html?showComment=1400195196862#c1520834790593736374' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2012/05/problem-of-coming-out-is-same-no-matter.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-9207803538475933182' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/9207803538475933182' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1493544820"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:06 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6847486690667924704</id><published>2013-12-03T00:33:57.385-08:00</published><updated>2013-12-03T00:33:57.385-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Thank you for your post.

A few months back I had thought of staying in a tent in a willing friends or strangers backyard. I already had the tools I needed just by using my head. Showering at the gym making sure i had money to pay for that. Finding cheap storage for my big items i just will not let go of. Going to the local college that have late hours so i can use the internet print forms job search. Making use of the 24 hour laundromat. I did a lot of things to make it easier for myself except accept that i&amp;#39;m homeless and ok with it. Every time i look at renting my options are i either get a second job or forever be broke unable to pay of debts or even have a fun outing or just some alone time. It scares me. I have fought to not be homeless and succeeded only to get slapped in the face by crazy situations that lead me back to the lonely road of homelessness in this society. Another post led me to this one. It talked about shelters. For some reason I always opted out of staying at one. I never knew why. I see it now. The hours they let you stay are ridiculous. it takes a chunk out of time i could be using somewhere else. I rarely sleep before 1am and by the time i do get to sleep i still have to get back up and find a way to kill time before i got o work. No point in it. I&amp;#39;ve had many comments made about me being ok with sleeping in a tent even some really off the wall ones. So i let my fear of how my friends looked at me cause me to fight for an apartment. I&amp;#39;m not happy because i&amp;#39;m letting other peoples image of what life is supposed to be control mine when I know EXACTLY what I want. Oh thank you for putting mt heart in the right place. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind having an apartment and maybe one day i&amp;#39;ll find a good job or be in a situation where i can do it comfortably. For now though. I&amp;#39;m gonna make my dram of actually having a tiny home someday a reality and poop on those that don&amp;#39;t support me. **HUgs and many thanks***</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/9207803538475933182/comments/default/696083553692842685'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/9207803538475933182/comments/default/696083553692842685'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2012/05/problem-of-coming-out-is-same-no-matter.html?showComment=1381336828645#c696083553692842685' title=''/><author><name>Chloe Gresham</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01461036591215077386</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2012/05/problem-of-coming-out-is-same-no-matter.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-9207803538475933182' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/9207803538475933182' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-2087452183"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="9:40 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7877266698204763837</id><published>2013-05-03T03:29:21.006-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-03T03:29:21.006-07:00</updated><title type='text'>You&amp;#39;ve been a huge inspiration to me.

Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I am living on Section 8 but hate the noise of the apartments so I have been considering moving into my car or selling it and getting a camper truck.   &lt;br /&gt;Every year HUD comes in and snoops all over the place to make sure I am not destroying anything and 6 months later management does their inspection. They give you 48 hours notice and if you can&amp;#39;t be home to make sure they don&amp;#39;t do a deep snoop, you are SOL.  They will go in anyway. &lt;br /&gt;I appreciate having a home, but at what cost to my dignity and privacy.  Homelessness is starting to look good.&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with people that we have a choice to be happy or sad.  If that were the case, schizophrenia and other mental disorders would not exist.  Maybe for most it is a choice, but not all.  It is no different then saying you have a choice to have cancer or diabetes.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/9207803538475933182/comments/default/6367104950979255029'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/9207803538475933182/comments/default/6367104950979255029'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2012/05/problem-of-coming-out-is-same-no-matter.html?showComment=1361030562001#c6367104950979255029' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2012/05/problem-of-coming-out-is-same-no-matter.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-9207803538475933182' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/9207803538475933182' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1758887344"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:02 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-732975930174756779</id><published>2013-01-10T23:56:03.840-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-10T23:56:03.840-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I am in the process of losing my house &amp;amp; have ...</title><content type='html'>I am in the process of losing my house &amp;amp; have just found your blog.

From the core of my being, I get it. Homelessness, and all that it entails, was ridiculously hard for me. It permanently altered how I view the world, and other people. It&amp;#39;s not glamorous or fun. At the same time, I was never, for one moment, ashamed. I was very *aware*, and very wary, of how other people *perceived* me negatively or with suspicion or judgment. But my opinion about myself was never negative, never touched by shame. In fact, I was proud. In my mind, and in truth this is how it was, I was simply using all my mental and spiritual resources to get through a series of large, at times overwhelming obstacles, without the added benefit of being able to be &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; about it. Unlike cancer, or a physical impairment, homelessness is seen as the homeless person&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;fault&amp;quot; - a moral, or intellectual, or some other personal failing. That is the difference, in why I couldn&amp;#39;t be &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; with others. Not because I was ashamed (not even for a second) but I was all too understanding of how society is in denial, in guilt, uses a blame-the-victim narrative. Other parallels for this dynamic are people with different sexual orientations, people who have experienced molestation incest or rape, people who were abused as children (the most frequent questions are &amp;quot;*why* did they rape/abuse/hurt you?&amp;quot; lol, which indicates the mentality of the person asking the question). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for this long post. I just wanted to say a heartfelt thank you for writing about this personal stuff. I also have a few people in my life who, like with you and your grandfather, I can&amp;#39;t even write about here because it&amp;#39;s so painful. How, I can try to see that their intent isn&amp;#39;t to hurt me, but inevitable, lack of understanding carries some degree (oftentimes a large degree) of built-in hurt. And I get that so much. But thanks for having the courage to write about it, because I have to admit I was feeling pretty down today (related to topics discussed in your post) but you know, it&amp;#39;s nice to know that you are not the first person to see life (seperate, apart, perhaps more clearly as a result) the way you do.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/9207803538475933182/comments/default/5341541773621403168'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/9207803538475933182/comments/default/5341541773621403168'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2012/05/problem-of-coming-out-is-same-no-matter.html?showComment=1341270114974#c5341541773621403168' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2012/05/problem-of-coming-out-is-same-no-matter.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-9207803538475933182' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/9207803538475933182' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1209306846"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:01 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6463188293882314552</id><published>2012-05-26T07:59:15.406-07:00</published><updated>2012-05-26T07:59:15.406-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I just discovered your blog and want to thank you ...</title><content type='html'>I just discovered your blog and want to thank you for what you&amp;#39;ve shared.

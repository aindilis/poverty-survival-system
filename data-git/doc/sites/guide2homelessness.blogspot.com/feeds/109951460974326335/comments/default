I drive a MINI, hard to stretch out &amp;amp; using bathroom facilities overnight is a BIG concern.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;ve put my stuff in storage &amp;amp; joined the YMCA so that I can shower, maybe work out too, lol.&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;#39;s a beautiful library for day time hours but ... Still the problem of wanting to put a cot somewhere. The storage unit only allows about an hour each visit. I was told it&amp;#39;s not a hotel. There&amp;#39;s also AirBnB what an overnight can be had for a small some. Unfortunately, that small sum is needed for living expenses &amp;amp; bills.&lt;br /&gt;Portapotties? I&amp;#39;m a female so I can&amp;#39;t use receptacle. Can I read back issues of your blog?&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time being homeless which is actually a relief to face what had been my greatest fear. Huntington Beach CA is a safe community &amp;amp; I always said, if I was going to be homeless this would be a good place.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/2289026369658928645'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/2289026369658928645'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1468872289291#c2289026369658928645' title=''/><author><name>Melanie Vance - Ryan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07090526548671211066</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CoHpeaDD--M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEM/nN6EbwwSrMY/s512-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-351632415"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="1:04 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4912803733890528176</id><published>2015-05-20T20:50:58.066-07:00</published><updated>2015-05-20T20:50:58.066-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Many Walmart locations are putting a stop to overn...</title><content type='html'>Many Walmart locations are putting a stop to overnight parking.

A...</title><content type='html'>You could park at the school while in class, no? And you would get a parking sticker! Depending on class times you could stay in their lot. This is good. Parking in Boston can be a nightmare. Careful of the winter bans. (Read the signs) I came back to nurse once and the car was gone. My suggestions include a yoga mat, sleeping bag, a long coat to fit over your shorter one. Also bring something to pee in. Don&amp;#39;t go out at night to do this, you lose far to much heat and it&amp;#39;s noticeable. (Ifit gets too cold, gosomewhere to get warm,the hospital, mall, where people might be anyway. Boston is not LA. )Use a visor for the windshield. You can wash up at school. In older schools they have those sliding doors over bookshelves. Have a look. Almost no professors use them. Good for a small stash of sweaters. Also, tell a food pantry you can&amp;#39;t cook and they will give you stuff you can just eat in the car.(I&amp;#39;m nearby!)  Hope this helps.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/5939692149006761098'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/5939692149006761098'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1419988926573#c5939692149006761098' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/4648247529553876453'/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1012200564"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:22 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1414733858872834292</id><published>2014-04-27T22:07:46.043-07:00</published><updated>2014-04-27T22:07:46.043-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I got laid off a job and was going through a break...</title><content type='html'>I got laid off a job and was going through a break up at the same time a few years back and had to go to the city to find work. I had to live in my vehicle for a while .  I did find  a job and eventually got back on my feet,got my own apartment  ,and Just so you know . I had NO ONE to help me . It&amp;#39;s a cruel world ,isn&amp;#39;t it ? LOL . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have here some tips for anyone who may find themselves in this position . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 Do it sooner than later! if you lost your job and your relationship and haven&amp;#39;t found a new one within a few weeks.Don&amp;#39;t wait ! sell and get rid of  everything you don&amp;#39;t need and store what you absolutely cant live without at a family member house or rent a low cost storage  shed or store them at a friends house . Get the hell out while you still have an unemployment check and  savings income comming in . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 Go to where there is work(the city) and Get a 24 hr health club membership with a club that has many locations . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need a place to go to any time of the day or night to exercise ,be checked out by others, to boost your self esteem and take showers .(believe me its fun!wink wink and a great way to meet people :))  Also the health club is a great place to be influenced by others who have a strong spirit of motivation!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 Stay Fit,dress well, look good ,and smell good .  This is important ! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 Sleep during the hours of 5 am to 10 pm . this is the best hours to blend in . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5 NEVER let anyone know you are living in your vehicle until you you get back on your feet later if you dare . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#6 NEVER Look like you are homeless and living in your vehicle . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get your back windows tinted dark (or do it yourself ) so that people can not see inside and discover you are living in your vehicle .  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#7 go to a UPS store in the area  you plan to work, live and open up a mail box . &lt;br /&gt;This will give you a  a permanent address .  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#8 Now that you have your permanent address go to temp agencies  and put in your job application and put your application at all places in the area that you think you might be able to land a job .in the mean time go and try to hussle up under the table work anywhere you can . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#9 While your waiting to get a job spend your time learning at the  library and keep improving yourself through education .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - Stay strong ,be hopeful ,exercise . Have fun,keep clean ,fit and dress well ,Never let on that you live in a car.   Enjoy your freedom , learn and grow, read and gain skills And work hard!  You will get a job eventually but you might just miss the good ole days .  </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/1414733858872834292'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/1414733858872834292'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1398661666043#c1414733858872834292' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-682553253"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:07 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6046773759977110233</id><published>2014-04-27T19:36:09.165-07:00</published><updated>2014-04-27T19:36:09.165-07:00</updated><title type='text'>The riskiest time is night time .The best time is ...</title><content type='html'>The riskiest time is night time .The best time is in the daytime . there are thousands of places to blend in during the daytime . 5 am to 10 pm .

I have put a very thick padding, covered by sleeping basket and numerous sheets.  All the windows are dark tinted plus I put on those black cling sheets on the windows only.  The front side windows are slightly tinted and the front window is clear.  I have an suv and I have laid down the back seats and I have plenty of room to sleep.  I even have a twin size childs bed mattress, chaise lounge cusion, slepping bag and numerous blankets.I understand I should find 10 different places to sleep every night and rotate. I am scared stiff being a femle and alone.  I agree with the walmart parking lot but ours says no overnight parking.  They do any way.  I guess I will stay as long as someone else does.  Homeless are allowed in the public library.  I&amp;#39;ve learned a whole lot from your posts.  I think the only real problem I might be facing is eating and showering.  You used to be able to take a shower and get a boxed lunch at the local goodwill but they moved away.  I admit I&amp;#39;m frightened but I have pagemarked your article.  I will read more tomorrow.  I want to be prepaired.  I have to do this for 3 years until I will be 62 and can get income housing.  I just want to make it through the winters. Thanks for all you do.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/2065847248969865242'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/2065847248969865242'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1372914755917#c2065847248969865242' title=''/><author><name>Debbie</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1366282772"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:12 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-9132011046121172120</id><published>2013-03-07T02:46:28.647-08:00</published><updated>2013-03-07T02:46:28.647-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I&amp;#39;m addicted to this blog.

I think it&amp;#39;s true that if you were ever homeless, you never quite give up your fear that it&amp;#39;s going to happen again no matter how much money you make/save.  I read that even Madonna, a multi-millionaire, is super cheap and saves money because she was once homeless in NYC.  She said &amp;quot;you never forget having to eat out of a trash can&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m concerned about the people who decide that they are going to leave their home city and go somewhere else, tour the country, etc if they find themselves homeless.  To me that seems like the worst thing you can do.  Nobody knows you!  Nobody cares! I&amp;#39;ve been in the same area for the last 17 years.  Why?  Because I have years and years of relationships built up, friendships, people who know me and care if I live or die.  Over 17 years they&amp;#39;ve seen me couch surf, in apartment after apartment, relationship after relationship, job after job, etc.  They know me and would never think bad thoughts about me if I came to a rough patch.  Friends are more precious than gold in this situation.  They will give you places to stay, job opportunities, encouragement, ideas, hookups...they are your lifeline.  Why would you leave the area where they can help you, to go somewhere nobody knows you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wonder if anyone here has heard of the Tiny House people?  There is now an entire group of people who are harvesting the frames from old RVs and building on top of these frames entire tiny houses that can be moved around with them, complete with bathrooms, kitchens, sleeping lofts, etc.  It&amp;#39;s absolutely amazing.  The appliances run on solar or propane, so they spend hardly any money on monthly bills and can save a fortune.  LOTS of people are simply CHOOSING this lifestyle because they can save their money rather than giving it to a bank or landlord. This makes SO MUCH SENSE TO ME.  I love it.  If you have carpentry skills you can make a tiny house for about 3,000 or less.  You can use &amp;quot;found&amp;quot; materials for lots of stuff in the house- google &amp;quot;tiny house&amp;quot; to find out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/9132011046121172120'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/9132011046121172120'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1362653188647#c9132011046121172120' title=''/><author><name>Xtine</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12665223646138270790</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='22' height='32' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__YlFJugpxqA/Sv36r1VuG6I/AAAAAAAAAAY/pSWpX0vqb2c/S220/AbsAug.21.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1823063596"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="2:46 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1788604433986149186</id><published>2013-03-04T10:19:13.276-08:00</published><updated>2013-03-04T10:19:13.276-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I&amp;#39;ve just recently become homeless here in WA....</title><content type='html'>I&amp;#39;ve just recently become homeless here in WA.

I do have a car and so I am trying to figure out safe places for a lonely female to park.I am definitely terrified..I found this article helpful.I had thought about a campground but they charge almost as much as a hotel..might as well get a hotel for that amount of time then camp.Anyway tomorrow night I will be staying at a rest stop,then walmart the next night,and then who knows.. I am still scouting spots to park.My main concern is knowing where to shower and keep clean so I can find work.This is so hard and what I find frustrating is how CRUEL people are to the homeless..they always assume you are on drugs or a drunk etc and thats why you ended up homeless..not so. Anyway this has brought up many things for me and as soon as I am on my feet financially I WILL be coming up with ways to help others in the same situation.Again,thank you for this post.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/8627146389388259570'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/8627146389388259570'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1359172173070#c8627146389388259570' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1021265190"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="7:49 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-9203017480574869008</id><published>2012-10-21T14:24:15.171-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T14:24:15.171-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Thank you so much for this blog!!

I just moved back to CA from Utah after being laid off for a couple of years and finally got another job back here...only to get laid off again. This time with no where to live.  Was couch surfing with friends and rotating motels on weekends to give them all &amp;quot;alone time&amp;quot; so as not to overstay my welcome.  Anyway, when I got laid off everyone&amp;#39;s attitude changed and first question was &amp;quot;how long do you think you will have to stay?&amp;quot;.  I&amp;#39;ve overstayed my welcome, and with no job it scares them into thinking you&amp;#39;ll be staying on their couch for months, SO, I&amp;#39;m staying in my car.  The first two nights I was stupid and tried mall parking, got rousted by rent a cop and the shocked look on his face when he saw a woman get out of the car was kind of a relief...he was very kind and very concerned. Both rentacops looked the same way, second one even let me stay for two more hours.  Now I&amp;#39;ve read your blog and know to try hotels or etc.  The biggest concern is my safety since I&amp;#39;m a woman.  Both those guys were so worried it&amp;#39;s gotten me worried, and I&amp;#39;ve only seen men or couples posting here.  Any advice for a single woman please?

The idea completely excites me! I work part-time and go to school, so I don&amp;#39;t really make enough to pay for an apartment. My dad kicked me out a couple years ago, and I&amp;#39;ve been staying with my grandparents. I just feel like a burden though, and long for my own quiet space. I have a &amp;#39;98 Jeep Grand Cherokee which I&amp;#39;ve slept in before, so I&amp;#39;m sure it would be a comfy place to live. I work at a 24-hour grocery store, so I think I could park there at night--other employees know my car and wouldn&amp;#39;t think it odd for it to be there at all. I hope I can find the courage to just make this happen. My fear of what my family will think has been holding me back for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again, I love reading (and re-reading) your posts!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/8053713449176082562'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/8053713449176082562'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1344403135061#c8053713449176082562' title=''/><author><name>Lindsey</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-853707460"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:18 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1579003344553625531</id><published>2012-01-09T13:42:18.680-08:00</published><updated>2012-01-09T13:42:18.680-08:00</updated><title type='text'>1.I like 24 hour supermarkets that don&amp;#39;t have ...</title><content type='html'>1.I like 24 hour supermarkets that don&amp;#39;t have any overnight parking restriction signs and security guards cruising around. I drive a minivan so i blend in to the envirnment pretty good. Cops will think you&amp;#39;re either shopping or working there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I also like 24 hour fitness clubs. People will think you&amp;#39;re inside working out. As long as you have a vehicle that blends in to the envirnment and you have tinted windows and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.Church parking lots. Nobody will bother you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Home depot or Lowes parking lots. You&amp;#39;ll be the only one there, which makes you stand out. But they turn the parking lot&amp;#39;s lights off and nobody can&amp;#39;t see you from a distance. Sometimes they have their rental vans parked, so if you park close to it, and you have a van, then you&amp;#39;ll just blend in. It can be dangerous cuz there&amp;#39;s no one around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.Hotel parking lots. I park close to everybody and i just blend in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have to try park &amp;amp; ride areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never park in a big mall!! There&amp;#39;s always security guards with flashlights checking out parked vehicles. They don&amp;#39;t allow overnight parking. They will check your vehicle, if they can see you inside, they will wake you up with a flashlight on your face and bother you. If you cover the windows and they can&amp;#39;t see you inside, they will knock on the window to see if someone is inside, if you don&amp;#39;t answer, they will leave either a warning or a ticket on your windshield. They&amp;#39;re a pain in the ass.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/1579003344553625531'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/1579003344553625531'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1326145338680#c1579003344553625531' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1538620256"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="1:42 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-114215310057838520</id><published>2011-12-14T21:07:07.721-08:00</published><updated>2011-12-14T21:07:07.721-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Church parking lots on weekday nights - always wor...</title><content type='html'>Church parking lots on weekday nights - always worked for me.

You wash your hair every 2 days in a sink by doing in in 2 parts the top first and then the bottom the next day. Use olive oil soap because it will rinse out in 1 or 2 cups of water. Keep a beany for the days you do the top and when you walk out of the restroom noone will see the wet hair on top. This will keep your hair clean.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/1531890599833535377'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/1531890599833535377'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1320694617962#c1531890599833535377' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1402747667"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="11:36 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4380166851433044820</id><published>2011-10-30T18:32:15.015-07:00</published><updated>2011-10-30T18:32:15.015-07:00</updated><title type='text'>During the end of my hostile marriage it was very ...</title><content type='html'>During the end of my hostile marriage it was very difficult for me to be at home and I couldn&amp;#39;t afford a hotel every night so I slept in my van my nights to avoid a very difficult situation. I would recommend to not sleep the whole night in one spot to avoid detection. A good choice to to sleep is a late night restaurant or a bar and place that closes late into the night, like 2:00, stay until 3:00am when there still might be workers there, that way an authority might just think your a worker closing up. I have my alarm set to wakeup and then have a preplanned 24hour place to go to to have breakfast like a Denny&amp;#39;s. You can then have breakfast, coffee, use the restroom, go back in the car and either sleep alittle more or move on. I felt the safest this way. After this you can move on to a early morning conglomerate where there are cars parked at 4:00am for the workers, like a Home Depot or Target and blend in, sleep and little more than leave. There&amp;#39;s never a problem sleeping during the day, so if you need some extra sleep just take a nap during the day somewhere else.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/4380166851433044820'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/4380166851433044820'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1320024735015#c4380166851433044820' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1402747667"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="6:32 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6242931291072394668</id><published>2011-08-04T13:19:01.450-07:00</published><updated>2011-08-04T13:19:01.450-07:00</updated><title type='text'>There is a sub-culture of people who live in their...</title><content type='html'>There is a sub-culture of people who live in their cars who call themselves &amp;quot;vandwellers&amp;quot;.

I came across it while on my laptop in a public library in Sarasota..Today is May 29th, and it is 90 and humid. I differ from most of the posters, as I do not plan or need to be homeless(sleeping in my car). I am traveling from NY to relocate in Fla..Im 45 yrs old..I slept in my car last nite because I get a monthly pension and it comes last day of the month..2 more days. I sympathize with your plight( if u see it as one)..A previous post commented on killing a day waiting for a place to sleep..I have $2 for 2 more days, enough gas to get me back to the hotel parking lot I slept in tonite and hopefully back tmrw nite. It is so hot, and this library closes in 45 mins...and shade is very hard to come by here. I parked my &amp;#39;01 Nissan Xterra (tinted back windows) in a hotel parking lot, far away from the closest lot light as possible. The lot got fuller around 10, and eventually filled up(memorial day wknd)by midnite. I layed in the back with seat down and sweat my a** off &amp;#39;til about 4 am when it finally cooled down. I got out of my truck around 7:15, grabbed my laptop and cell phone and pretended to be calling someone I was waiting for to come down..I spoke loud enough for the front desk to hear me say &amp;quot;Well, hurry down...I&amp;#39;m gonna grab a cup of coffee, you want one?&amp;quot; I then went into the continental bkfst area had some powdered eggs, sausage, juice and coffee( i took one to go for my friend too;)...Sorry for the rambling, I just wanted to relay my story. Aside from the blistering humidity it was kinda exciting, but then I don&amp;#39;t have to do this every nite, just 2 more. I wish all of you out there good luck, sincerely, in finding a more stable living situation. I am not judging...this is a very tough time we are living in.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/4583012124689541323'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109951460974326335/comments/default/4583012124689541323'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html?showComment=1306700829682#c4583012124689541323' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/finding-parking-place.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109951460974326335' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109951460974326335' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-760379838"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="1:27 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-1141903070615559383</id><published>2011-05-15T20:15:18.302-07:00</published><updated>2011-05-15T20:15:18.302-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Anything that works for you is okay.

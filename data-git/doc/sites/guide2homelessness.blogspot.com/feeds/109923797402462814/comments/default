A 10 inch dead air space under you at zero degrees is a rule of thumb. I have not made one yet, but I am planning how to make a body size “Styrofoam cooler” to sleep in during frigid weather. I made them for my farm cats to sleep in; clean bedding and a flap door and it worked perfectly. I plan to leave the head end open for some kind of fabric covering. If the top opened like a hinged picnic cooler, it would make it easier to get in and out. Strong rigid sides would permit bedding versus being zipped into a claustrophobic mummy bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying dry is definitely the key.  Taking your bedding to a laundry mat and putting it through the dryer may be the least costly life saver and provide more cold weather comfort.  I had the problem of my breath freezing and making big patches of ice by my face on my pillow or sleeping bag. It was a necessary nuisance but I folded a beach towel under my head and kept moving the ice patches away from my face. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other “breath warmer” idea, I am planning is to have the air intake tube at the foot of the bed, the tube would come through the “warmer bedding” and exit by the head of the bed. A respirator type face mask would have a flutter valve that would automatically direct the flow of air.  It would not be real comfortable (like a C-pap) but it might provide a lot of breathing comfort in extreme winter weather.  The moisture would not freeze by my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candles and flames are definitely out for me. What ever heat they generate, they foul the air and give me an asthma attack. Carbon monoxide is an extreme hazard even with what one might crack a window and think it is OK.  The CO detector is a great safety device. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Keeping your body clean is a real challenge but it will keep your bedding and clothes cleaner. Hospital type body bathing wipes are great.  If you have a source of warm water, fill a couple of gallon (milk) jugs and keep them over night in a good grade Styrofoam cooler. You hopefully will have liquid water in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109923797402462814/comments/default/1190061972527306778'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109923797402462814/comments/default/1190061972527306778'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/staying-warm.html?showComment=1421346192275#c1190061972527306778' title=''/><author><name>Hallux Valgus</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/14860742464993585072</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/staying-warm.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109923797402462814' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109923797402462814' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-248760710"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:23 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8650394794096066365</id><published>2014-12-28T06:22:49.693-08:00</published><updated>2014-12-28T06:22:49.693-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Recently I lost my job and after 6 mo of putting i...</title><content type='html'>Recently I lost my job and after 6 mo of putting in aps and searching for a job, my money finally depleted. Because I wasn&amp;#39;t fired I had to wait the allotted time before filing for unemployment. In the mean time I was evicted. With no other option, me, 1 other, and my cat have been sleeping in the car. I created a wool tent in the car. mind you it is a hatch back so the seats fold down flat creating a makeshift bed. So I bought the wool military blankets (had some already) an some Velcro strips. all 4 sides of the blankets have them :) i applied strips to the &amp;quot;ceiling/roof&amp;quot;, doors, and floor. once in place it is like a box tent. one window stays cracked and a slit was made in the blanket and i clip that slit to the cracked window with a hair clip ;) it stays pretty warm!! We also bought hand and foot warmers but they have these new ones that are larger and you place the sticky side to your clothes on the insides. they last 12 hrs. i place them on my lower back and chest, put feet warmers in my socks and the hand warmers in my mittens. i wear a ski mask and fleece hat. lots of blankets! i do have the bonus of another persons body heat...and the cat, but we have managed t stay warm in the teen temps!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109923797402462814/comments/default/8650394794096066365'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109923797402462814/comments/default/8650394794096066365'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/staying-warm.html?showComment=1419776569693#c8650394794096066365' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/staying-warm.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109923797402462814' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109923797402462814' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1719484251"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="6:22 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-4776587424663016166</id><published>2014-12-03T11:37:11.317-08:00</published><updated>2014-12-03T11:37:11.317-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I am a 44 year old female and have been homeless f...</title><content type='html'>I am a 44 year old female and have been homeless for a week now.

It&amp;#39;s been in the 20&amp;#39;s a night so I&amp;#39;m thankful I have that comfort.   I was able to plan well for my homeless situation.  I had about three months to get ready and set up the garage.  I guess for a homeless person I&amp;#39;m pretty comfortable.  I found your blog and learned a lot from you.

I arrived in Fairbanks on a frozen November day with every thing I owned stuffed in my car, including my dog, and no where to go. I was so lucky to have gone to Allmart and noticed electrical outlets at many parking spaces. After a gas eating frozen night that bottemed out at -50 I went  in Allmart bought a $16 electric heater and extension cord and wound up living in that lot for almost 4 weeks. It was the most exciting miserable boring freezing challenging frustraiting disturbing rewarding spiritual experiences of my life. I did have prior near arctic homless conditioning about 5 years ago while becoming homless in Wyoming in January. The temp stayed between -20 and -48 the entire month. It was actually harder in Wyoming because there was no Allmart or outlets. I actually just became homless again 4 days ago and am back in my car with all I own and my dog. Hit -12 last night and -4 the night befor but it&amp;#39;s supposed to hit +52! I&amp;#39;ll be catching up on warmth and sleep if it does. I keep ending up homless because I&amp;#39;m disabled and have a small income so I have to rent cheaper places that become uninhabitable for me either from conditions or landlord harasment. It is amazing what you can endure and achieve if you don&amp;#39;t panic. I may freeze and die 1 day from doing this but I can&amp;#39;t think of a more beautiful place I&amp;#39;de want to die anyway. I can&amp;#39;t do the resue mission stuff, it conflicts with my disability.

I am responsible and try my best to be kind.  I lost everything due to a tick bite in 1997.  It is now 2013 and due to all things in between I am homeless, living in my car which I might add I am beyond lucky to have.  Just read the guys response who had a Zen house, how he&amp;#39;s wasting his life working???? I would give my eye teeth to have a decent job instead of bowing to the minimum wage Gawd.  It is beyond awful and every morning I wake up and every day and every night I live in complete fear.  If one bad thing happens, if I get sick, or hurt myself, if my car breaks down, I&amp;#39;m done.  And what is this about being homeless and not working??? I work all the time I just don&amp;#39;t make any money.  I am soooo stressed out.  I just want a safe place to lay my head and someone to tell me everything is going to be okay.  I never want this to happen to anyone, ever ever ever!  I also tutor on a site called Adult Home Education.  I am a good teacher and care about a lot of things.  But right now I&amp;#39;m not able to help hardly anyone!!!!  I raised my children alone and was dirt broke most of the time, always trying to find work.  I had NO BACKUP and family doesn&amp;#39;t want to help for the long term it takes to get back on your feet and the cost involved.  I have to concentrate daily on just making it thtough, enough money to eat, gas pay the car insurance and the Y so I can take a shower and my car has everything I own in it and hiding that is difficult.  Clothing is a huge issue to hide homelessness.  You can&amp;#39;t show up to work looking professional without decent clothes.  They need to be pressed and there is NO MONEY extra for dry cleaning.  So you have to find a cheap iron and find places with electricty so you can iron your clothes and go on that interview just HOPING against all HOPE that SOMEONE out there will hire you for more than minimum wage at a job that you are capable of doing.  This is not a dream world folks and don&amp;#39;t ever long to be in it. It is terrifying, humiliating, and devestating.  Do not make it out to be such a grand thing and there are still bills even being homeless to survive in this world and try to get ahead.  Dear God in Heaven help us all that have to go through it.  This gentleman that started this blog is wonderful and so helpful because I&amp;#39;m about to go through a Chicago winter in my car which I pray to God will keep working for me.  I am not undermining what he is saying but for the love of God do not make it seem like it is the way to go.  Although compared to any abusive situation within family it is definetly the choice.  I would rather die in my car than be made to feel terrible and worthless on a daily basis - and folks this is NOT drug or alcohol related at all - this is sickness - lyme disease creates long term severe athritis and so much more.  The savings I had - all gone.  My home - gone.  So far thank God and the Universe I am still making a go and trying everything I can to survive because as he says in his blog - I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109923797402462814/comments/default/7337552136092452189'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109923797402462814/comments/default/7337552136092452189'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/staying-warm.html?showComment=1380836654539#c7337552136092452189' title=''/><author><name>adulthomestudy</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13524482006376430409</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/staying-warm.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109923797402462814' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109923797402462814' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1761731897"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="2:44 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3797352442483555193</id><published>2013-08-19T23:03:13.172-07:00</published><updated>2013-08-19T23:03:13.172-07:00</updated><title type='text'>You need a writer who has experience with sleeping...</title><content type='html'>You need a writer who has experience with sleeping rough.

He would run the engine up until bedtime with the unit door open a bit to let the carbon monoxide out.  Then he&amp;#39;d close everything up tight, and use all the tips mentioned here -  A HAT, layered wool, space blanket, long johns, layered sleeping bags, mummy bag that covered the head.  It was cold, but safe and dark, and he could sleep undisturbed.  He had a 5-gallon sani-bucket that he&amp;#39;d use as needed, so he just had to get out of the truck, not leave his unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really amazed on how well my father mastered the art of road living.  He bought a lot of rotisserie chickens - they&amp;#39;re cheapest at sam&amp;#39;s club if you can get &amp;#39;em - $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To piggyback on Mobile Homemaker&amp;#39;s emphasis of a good night&amp;#39;s sleep - it&amp;#39;s invaluable.  He moved from colorado to Texas, and although he found another storage room, it was insufferably hot for him to sleep inside.  He did the Walmart lots, the Motel 6 parking lots, and parking at a campsite (max 2 week stay).  But his sleep was constantly interrupted by heat or light or noise, and that took a significant toll on his health, attitude, and mental cognition.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years later he was able to rent a place in a mobile home park.  The good rest really made a huge difference in his health and his mental awareness.  He&amp;#39;s always had that amazing kind of brilliance that comes out in &amp;quot;street smarts,&amp;quot; and he was eventually able to apply that to getting a job doing something he utterly loves.  For now, he has a roof over his head again.

About trying to stay warm in windy frigid conditions: I insulate my small car&amp;#39;s windows with newspaper and hold it in place with half of a pizza box. That is for the front windows. I have a foam and foil windshield cover that I turn foil Inward. A sleeping bag, tarp, feather pillow and a bag of laundry at my back to fill the void near the door is getting me through -15 degree F nights with 20 mph winds. I have a tarp that I can use for a bivy when it gets too bad.   One must take care to not get overheated though, and allow some natural evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;quot;nature call issue is big for me, also.&amp;quot;  I stop drinking 3 hrs before bed and pee before going to bed. I wear a neck scarf and a light headscarf, woolen socks, gloves, and a goretex jacket over my shirt and sweater.  The jacket has a hood that provides head protection, and the lightweight headscarf provides a good air pre-warming pocket to mitigate icy throat syndrome (which can be followed by bronchitis/pneumonia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I find I have to do in frigid temps is write my morning agenda (in ridiculous detail)  on paper at night while I am in a warm location (Starbucks?) as the brain stops functioning about the same time fingers get stiff…definitely by 0400.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My car is small so I do not have much room, but at the same time, I can find better hiding places a bit more away from the blasting winds, sometimes under cover of higher tree limbs to protect my windshield from heavy ice buildup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addressing fire in a car.  I admit sometimes I put my pillar candle in a  terra-cotta saucer in a small pail and make a foil reflector around it to direct heat away from the dash panel. It heats nicely -- much better than those so-called Kandle Heeters that waster more heat than they give off-- and gives me another 10-15 degrees above whatever thermal mass I have acquired by parking facing the sun all day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not easy, but it is doable.  The hygiene factor is huge. Over the past decade, mostly sleeping in car or woods, I have completed grad school, post grad, worked (my money goes to my children who have more material needs than I), and never had any trouble with LEOs (I often work WITH them and  THEY don&amp;#39;t know I have mostly been outward bound). No mental health issues, no substances other than hot coffee.  I do have a hiding place where I have a brick wood stove (rocket style) for heating water when it is not too wicked cold. A well positioned tarp provides water catchment into serially-placed buckets in rainy weather. Free distilled water! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I like it? While I love nature, not this lifestyle that ages one prematurely, but the alternatives are not viable options for me since my marriage broke up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am planning for a change hopefully later this year. But we will need to see. In the meantime, I will remain positive, loving, law-abiding and clean :).  Namaste.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109923797402462814/comments/default/378831580840246104'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109923797402462814/comments/default/378831580840246104'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/staying-warm.html?showComment=1358904264157#c378831580840246104' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/staying-warm.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109923797402462814' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109923797402462814' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1535137969"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:24 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2131028767754706831</id><published>2013-01-12T21:46:16.136-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-12T21:46:16.136-08:00</updated><title type='text'>@Mylestone &amp;quot;Breathing 0 degree air is certain...</title><content type='html'>@Mylestone &amp;quot;Breathing 0 degree air is certain death.&amp;quot; This is an absolute false statement, if it were true every one living in or near the Arctic Circle would die just walking out their front door. I lived in an unheated van RV (Class B) that I essentially built myself (the RV part not the vehicle) and slept in it for almost 3 years, through 2 winters in Colorado Springs to -13F with -46F windchill and was just fine, cold but fine. It will not harm your lungs or air passageways by just breathing in cold air. Here&amp;#39;s how I lived with that type of cold:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my Tempurpedic Deluxe model (4 years old at the time) in the van and it was hard as a rock for the first 20-40 minutes of laying on it when the temp got below +17F. As I laid on it my body temp warmed it and then the viscoelastic foam re-radiated the heat back to me. I wore a Wool base layer (Smartwool) with standard slacks and a cotton turtleneck from JcPenny. I had Wool sock liners with Wigwam 40 below socks over those, no gloves because my hands stayed inside the 0 degree Teton sleeping bag. For my head I had a Smartwool Balaclava and a Military Wool Watch Cap. The only thing uncovered was my nose as I pulled the hat over my eyes when I slept and had the Balaclava cover up to my nostrils. My nose NEVER got cold and the moisture went out into the van (you DO NOT cover your head with a sleeping bag, condensations builds up inside it, then bad things happen). If I felt a chill I had a big crappy, but thick, blanket I through over top of the sleeping bag. I should mention I wasn&amp;#39;t inside the sleeping bag, but rather used it as a giant comforter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem with this cold of an environment is having to pee 2 hours after you laid down and it&amp;#39;s 0F inside your vehicle. The cold makes your body urinate more than normal, which makes no biological sense. Of course getting up into that 0F space when you are nice and toasty in your bed sucks too, but it&amp;#39;s a price to pay for the freedom from the high prices of today&amp;#39;s American lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that I was gainfully employed that entire time and also used 24hr Fitness as my shower. In fact I have nearly always been employed while living that way. It&amp;#39;s a lifestyle for some of us that is far more preferred than &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; Americans live. ALL human being were nomadic for something like 96% of our existence (if you follow that Homo-sapiens have been around for roughly 75K years). It&amp;#39;s only been the last 3-5K years that humans have developed greed and forced others to exist FOR the lifestyle of the few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend against using anything that has a flame. It can kill you without you even realizing it. Several have mentioned a cigarette lighter type of heater or heated blanket. They are sadly uninformed as to the current draw of these devices and the purpose of the starting battery in your car/truck/van. An electric blanket could easily kill (and I mean seriously damage) your vehicles starting battery in as little as 1 hour of use. I am from a family of Electricians and an Electrical Engineer as a father, been there tried that. Electrical heat requires VAST amounts of current.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple truth of it is, the best ways of staying warm in cold climates are: Insulate your vehicle as much as you have the money/space for, dress in the appropriate layers, have the appropriately rated sleeping bag for your climate, and the water bottle trick, or some variant of it.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109923797402462814/comments/default/2131028767754706831'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109923797402462814/comments/default/2131028767754706831'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/staying-warm.html?showComment=1358055976136#c2131028767754706831' title=''/><author><name>DeLindsay</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01926493746605715153</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/staying-warm.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109923797402462814' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109923797402462814' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-447153835"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="9:46 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-9158669607305310998</id><published>2012-12-12T23:54:49.237-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-12T23:54:49.237-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Down is the best.

After reading thru a few posts, I came across the idea of a gym membership as a way to get a shower. I called our local Pilot and it was $12 to use there shower. I then called our local Planet Fitness because they had an offer for $10 but you needed to have a credit card too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fitness club was the right choice for me. There are other membership fees down the road but I think my $10 was well spent considering I can take showers as often as I need to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to everyone who has posted about this. It was such a blessing to have a shower this morning. I can think a lot clearer and I smell good too!!!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109869031261797893/comments/default/2132381386362611882'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109869031261797893/comments/default/2132381386362611882'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/truck-stops.html?showComment=1404909021343#c2132381386362611882' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/truck-stops.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109869031261797893' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109869031261797893' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-865452342"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:30 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2512314291227718860</id><published>2014-06-25T19:25:36.682-07:00</published><updated>2014-06-25T19:25:36.682-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Im a trucker as well.

I am too cheap to pay for a hotel room and do use truck stops to shower, and rest stops to sleep; however, I have to point out that there are a few states in the south where they hassle those who nap at rest stops.  Gee, what are rest stops for, only using the rest room?  Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were the states where I had enforcers shaking and banging on the car windows.  I&amp;#39;m not sure about Georgia or Florida, but the other states mentioned above are very unfriendly when it comes to even napping in their rest stops.  The only thing to a lot of this advice on this blog is to be careful, when taking advantage of advice on this site or blog, is to not abuse the privileges for yourself or others so what is advised on here becomes extinct. I hope this makes sense.  General society is sadly put off by homeless people or those who might appear as if they are homeless, and they don&amp;#39;t want to see them.  Make your car look as if you are just in it for the day or on a vacation.  I think some people who live in their cars get used to what&amp;#39;s in there and don&amp;#39;t realize that their car looks as if, not only they live in it, but they have been living in it a long time.  If you can&amp;#39;t store your goods in the trunk then you have too much that you are carrying with you and need to purge, because you have blown your cover as a homeless person; also empty your garbage multiple times per day, just as a person would who&amp;#39;s on the road traveling.  Truck Stops are a great place to shower, but I have been told in the past at some places that they give truckers priority over travelers (their reasoning: that not all hotels or motels will take truckers so they have a greater need for showers); be prepared for that, but not all that common.  ASK, at Walmart, truck stops, etc. if you can sleep there for a while when you are purchasing a cup of coffee or gasoline, describe your car and tell them you are out on the road and are a danger to be on the road because you are so tired; but PURCHASE something when you ask.  Asking, especially late at night those people have always said yes to me, and many have thanked me for asking (again, not abusing the privilege by just assuming it&amp;#39;s okay).  Night shift personnel are usually not the ones pushing for management positions; however, that&amp;#39;s the time  you can have a run in with an over zealous lot security guard, who can ruin your nights sleep.  </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109869031261797893/comments/default/5899652281163913513'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109869031261797893/comments/default/5899652281163913513'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/truck-stops.html?showComment=1391863119725#c5899652281163913513' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/truck-stops.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109869031261797893' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109869031261797893' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-885770388"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="4:38 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-3594862108294703689</id><published>2014-01-01T13:17:21.482-08:00</published><updated>2014-01-01T13:17:21.482-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I do it all the time.

I never had a problem and I never gave problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109869031261797893/comments/default/7981591630250837339'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109869031261797893/comments/default/7981591630250837339'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/truck-stops.html?showComment=1386027749165#c7981591630250837339' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/truck-stops.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109869031261797893' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109869031261797893' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-2125447766"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="3:42 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2432556119217011524</id><published>2013-10-31T05:24:59.651-07:00</published><updated>2013-10-31T05:24:59.651-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Im not technically homeless because i live in a sm...</title><content type='html'>Im not technically homeless because i live in a small camper on my friends property.

I refuse to fly, so I decided to drive out with my dog. However, I had limited funds for the trip and I knew I was going to be sleeping in the car at least once, in the winter of course. Gas was going to cost me $150-200 each way, so I had $400 in the bank and about $50 pocket money. So here&amp;#39;s a recap of my cross country trip on the cheap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions were pretty simple; all I had to do was stay on the i-90 in Buffalo, heading south through PA &amp;amp; OH until it became the i-80, which goes cross-country. Also note that along the trip at certain cities there are weird exits and highways that I had to take in order to stay on the i-80. As far as the tolls go, they were completely asinine the first half (mostly on i-90). In total, I probably dropped $15-20 on tolls. This was my biggest complaint of the whole trip. Did it really cost them $20 to let me roll over the pavement?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding fuel, I actually drove 5-10 under the speed limit “taking it easy”. This will actually save you money, and it DID because the estimate online said I was going to spend $211, and I only spent $150!!! All you have to do is find the “sweet spot” between 1.5 and 2.5 thousand RPM’s. Another thing… in NY, there really aren’t any “full service” stations, so I didn’t even know what I was getting into when I stopped at one in PA. In addition to wasting money on fuel, I had to leave a tip. You’re going to want to avoid those to save extra cash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me tell you something about Indiana. It might be the most backwards state in the union. NY, PA, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado… all had welcome centers at each end of the state and proper rest stops along the way. Indiana had neither. I was expecting to stop and sleep at the Indiana welcome center when I got across the border. There WAS NO Indiana welcome center. About 50 miles in I found a “rest stop”, which was a noisy &amp;amp; bright gas station and McDonalds. They did not have any real rest stops in Indiana. Couldn’t even find a decent map! Worst sleep I ever had; don’t bother planning on sleeping in that state. And here’s something else: most people on the i-80 drive 5mph over the 70-75mph speed limit, and in Chicago they drive 15MPH over the speed limit and give you dirty looks if you’re doing the actual limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else was cake when I stopped at several rest stops along the way. “Modern Rest Stops”, which are marked on maps, were the best! You can use a limited amount (time) of free wifi internet, there are also dog walking areas marked, maps and clean heated bathrooms, and you can sleep right there in your car. I have an Army sleeping bag rated for winter conditions, so I was ok. The dog got covered up in blankets. I actually did stop at a hotel one time to give myself a good night’s sleep and a hot shower when a family member paid for it. Still, I didn’t feel right about them charging almost $100 to stay for a few hours and rest my head. And most will charge you a BS $10-20 pet fee! What a ripoff! Why don’t they go and confirm there was no damage to the room, and give you your money back?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I would recommend taking these types of trips in the summer instead. I saw several camping locations a long the way that were closed for the season, and I would have much rather slept in a tent than in the car. I hope this helps for anyone traveling cross-country along i-80. I wish truck stops had cheap rooms for rent (seriously, what about guys who drive car haulers with no sleeper cabs?). Oh yeah, most Wendy’s and similar restaurants have locked single bathrooms that you can clean up in privacy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am planning on heading home soon, taking this trip again. If anyone has any tips for me, feel free to let me know. I really don’t have much cash after spending the last of my money on gas for the trip back. Also if anyone is also making this trip and wants to maybe split some expenses, let me know! We could help each other out.

I was thrown out of my Steppy&amp;#39;s house as soon as he could do it (I was 16) and my alcoholic/addict mother was too into her process to care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can say one thing here, I&amp;#39;ll say this - I thank the owner of this blog for making this space for people to talk about this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a very puritanical, prudish nation (the US) that sees &amp;quot;homelessness&amp;quot; as a sort of communicable disease and attaches multiple stigmata to it in order to make you never want to end up in this situation and punishes you if you do. But the fact of the matter is that &amp;quot;homelessness&amp;quot; is the natural state of humanity and people were homeless for centuries before anyone conceived of a permanent built shelter. Most of the reason for this has to do with property ownership issues that have plagued civilization since the get-go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being &amp;quot;homeless&amp;quot; is not so bad. In fact, it pays to think outside the box in order to get ahead when you are in a bad way. But let me leave you this advice my young friend, do not get caught up into the following traps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Criminality. Being &amp;quot;homeless&amp;quot; is a crime in most places in the US. It has been this way since the 30&amp;#39;s when the original vagrancy laws were passed. If there is something you can avoid, I&amp;#39;d say crimes of any sort are the #1 way to ruin your life. The puritanical nature of US justice makes it so that a record will follow you for ever unless you are rich enough to beg in court for clemency. My crimes were committed over 20 years ago and it is still hard for me to get a job even today! Do not commit any theft, robbery or muggings! If you are female, don&amp;#39;t turn tricks! Be your own person, lie about your age if you have to and work under the table or get somewhere you can. Work, it feels good and good for your morale, the things you have will be your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Drugs/Alcohol. Please don&amp;#39;t pick it up, it&amp;#39;s a waste of time and money. A sober mind is the best survival tool you have, you need an unclouded mind and sharp wits, and good health to make it on the street. If you wonder what it&amp;#39;s like, believe me - it&amp;#39;s not too fun. If you need to feel better about things, buy yourself a nice pair of shoes and get a haircut, or go to a restaurant and order something off the menu that doesn&amp;#39;t cost too much but you can enjoy. For females: If you can afford it, get a pedicure :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Over reliance on others. If you have friends, don&amp;#39;t abuse your relationships with them just because you are in a bad way. You can make it if you try! I did it and so can you :) . Look into the other postings on this blog, get educated in the knowledge to make your own way in this world by yourself and for yourself. You&amp;#39;ll be happy you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can give you some advice it would be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Get yourself a hobby. I sew, knit and play guitar. I enjoy all these things immensely and the things I make are useful. Being able to repair clothing is not only a useful skill, you can make money helping other people who don&amp;#39;t know how. You can also make money performing with your instrument and if you are really good it will lead to better things for you. If you are musician, practice my dear, and practice and practice. You will make it if you try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Get a trade or two. Trades are very good to have, they are a source of revenue and people who need something done will not protest too much about who does the task for them. I am an electrician and I do hvac. I also do my own mechanical work and fix my own van and my bikes. A trade is also portable so you can take it with you where ever you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you and I wish you the best, where ever and whoever you are.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/6823326840685439645'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/6823326840685439645'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html?showComment=1392503212046#c6823326840685439645' title=''/><author><name>Silvia</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110236988653196126' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110236988653196126' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1313762224"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="2:26 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7344792493240430878</id><published>2013-12-06T11:45:31.177-08:00</published><updated>2013-12-06T11:45:31.177-08:00</updated><title type='text'>&amp;quot;Beware of people who want to take over respo...</title><content type='html'>&amp;quot;Beware of people who want to take over responsibility for your life. What they offer is seldom worth what they want in return. &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best advice I&amp;#39;d ever willingly give to someone. (I&amp;#39;m not a fan of advice, giving or taking.) I found this out the hard way over and over for about five years. I&amp;#39;m now looking out my window at the snow and thinking of all those times I *almost* ran away. All those times I had a place scouted out in the woods and a bag ready, and knew everything would work out if I just took the chance. I tend to take risks but this is one I&amp;#39;ve been skirting around the edges of since childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now the only thing holding me back is responsibility. I&amp;#39;m 23 now and I came back to my parents so I could find a better job and get the heck out of Kentucky. It&amp;#39;s been hell. I don&amp;#39;t even want the truck that I came back here to take over, but I do need it and can put it to very good use in the following years. It was only taken away because it was stolen and ran to ruin by someone I was living with. My feelings are that I must pay back the gift of having it paid off and fixed and given back, with responsible living, getting an apartment and squandering all my hard work to sit mindlessly in front of a computer screen and make wishes. It wouldn&amp;#39;t be appreciated, but it would supposedly make up for my &amp;quot;lack of appreciation.&amp;quot; No one knows how it feels to lay in a real bed at night after years of laying on what felt like rocks, or laying in a bed with someone who hated me. No one knows how amazing it feels to be able to cook food or this new world that I can&amp;#39;t help but hungrily take advantage of, but no one either believes that I will make up for how they&amp;#39;ve helped me, once I am able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know part of this is being willing to make a plan and do it whether anyone else understands that plan or not. I know part of it is being able to accept that others may not accept what I do, think, or feel or am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of this, though, is believing in myself when few others will. My brother is the only person who understands what it is like to run away and live that way. My brother is also the only person willing to help me, although he has his boundaries, he gets it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my job because one day I stormed out of this house pissed as all get out, walked down the street, and reapplied somewhere I had already been interviewed for a different position. This happened after everyone said to stop focusing so much on the job, and to move my focus on where I&amp;#39;m going to live (in this city that is new to me, where I only know my brother and who I tag along with him to hang out with). I got pissed because there were too many expectations to pacify my parents rather than actually *serve my best interests*, and got a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to take care of myself, because no one else is interested in my life the way I am. I don&amp;#39;t expect anyone to be, really, but for a moment I let myself trust my family. I told them my dreams and my dreams were tackled like a player holding the ball on a football field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went for a walk yesterday and remembered things. I saw the animals that lived outside every season of the year, and it hit me. I can do that too. I was meant to live here on this earth too, and do whatever I needed to do. I have a mind and passions in my heart the same as any other person, and it&amp;#39;s my job to fulfill my own life.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/7344792493240430878'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/7344792493240430878'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html?showComment=1386359131177#c7344792493240430878' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110236988653196126' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110236988653196126' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1626767396"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="11:45 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-558409417515910555</id><published>2012-12-19T07:16:41.319-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-19T07:16:41.319-08:00</updated><title type='text'>to the person who wanted a social security number....</title><content type='html'>to the person who wanted a social security number.

I really apreciate your advice I really do but I dont think people should criticize teens for wanting to. This is exactly what makes us want to run away. I have a pretty good life its just I&amp;#39;m so alone here when i was 13 me and my sister attempted to runaway but my stepdad caught us cause the dummy left the note on the floor I was being neglected then and she was going through a custody battle. Now I am almost 16 I still have thought about running away but I wouldnt be alone. I have my love my sister and her love we all get along and were all here for eachother and wer in this together.. Its just gonna be a page in our lives were going to learn things with our own expieriances.. And any og yall adults wanna say anything about &amp;quot;education&amp;quot; or stuff like that, think way back then when no one was in school or anything. We all have an education. We know what were getting ourselves into and my only regret would be hurting my mom I love her to death but its time for me to learn myself what lifes about. Im sorry mum.. I&amp;#39;ll see you again.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/2091655056704331869'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/2091655056704331869'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html?showComment=1328715918493#c2091655056704331869' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110236988653196126' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110236988653196126' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-440197200"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="7:45 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2387617759115167205</id><published>2012-01-22T16:35:15.910-08:00</published><updated>2012-01-22T16:35:15.910-08:00</updated><title type='text'>My advice to you is terrible.

I suppose I&amp;#39;m just looking for help, if I could get anybody&amp;#39;s advice, it would mean the world to me.&lt;br /&gt;Firday night, the beginning of the weekend, my mother called me a slob, screamed at me because my room was messy, I failed my first semester, &amp;amp; I was with my cousin when she shoplifted, getting it put on my record also. I&amp;#39;ve had sex, she knows it, &amp;amp; I have the patch. I didn&amp;#39;t put it on at first because there was a one day gap, &amp;amp; I didn&amp;#39;t want to put it on thinking it was working. I&amp;#39;m not a sex freak, I&amp;#39;m 15 years old, I&amp;#39;m responsible. To her, I&amp;#39;m a failure, slob, bum at home, shoplifter, irresponsible 15 year old girl who doesn&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m doing in life.&lt;br /&gt;Last night, she came into my room, and demanded that I give her my cell phone, which my father pays for. I told her no, and she attacked me. Pushed, hit, threw me on my bed. I kicked her off me in self defense, supposedly leaving a mark. She got off me, said I was &amp;quot;fucking insane&amp;quot;, &amp;amp; that she was calling the cops to take me to Juvi for abusing her. My bedroom is in the basement, with two windows. While she was upstaires, I decided in a matter of seconds I didn&amp;#39;t want to go, I didn&amp;#39;t want to put up with yearly fights I&amp;#39;ve had with her. So I jumped out my winow. I don&amp;#39;t think I should go to school, because cops are out looking for me..I don&amp;#39;t have anything but a hoodie, pajamas, slippers, my cell phone, and a charger. I live in MI, &amp;amp; the tempature outside..is slightly freezing.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/5303587997679450033'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/5303587997679450033'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html?showComment=1327256197939#c5303587997679450033' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110236988653196126' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110236988653196126' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1783309463"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:16 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-7396658790953083202</id><published>2011-12-19T05:33:00.070-08:00</published><updated>2011-12-19T05:33:00.070-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Life has been really rough lately.

Scratch that I stay with whomever because honestly I don&amp;#39;t have a home, I wouldn&amp;#39;t call this one. Ever since 2007 we haven&amp;#39;t had heat which means every winter I&amp;#39;m freezing to death under my covers on the floor.We don&amp;#39;t have food, the fridge is disgusting with mold everywhere. We also do not have hot water, I haven&amp;#39;t taken a bath in a month.! My dad doesn&amp;#39;t give me any money, and he&amp;#39;s a drunk! He tried to hit me with a hammer a couple weeks ago I ran out of the house. I even stayed with my grandmother untill she started doing cocaine, she even accused me of stealing her drugs and kicked me out I had to beg for money so I could go back to my dad house. I want to go to college but he will not help me nor will my mom. I feel so lonely :( I can&amp;#39;t even get a job, no one is hiring and I&amp;#39;ve been searching for months!

But, if you are a teenager from an acceptably wealthy family and you are not being physically/sexually abused or psychologically abused to an extreme degree, and your only reason for running away is ennui or because you are tired of academic pressure: I highly highly recommend not going through with actually running away. If you cannot muster up any affection at all for your parents, at least treat them as a resource from which you can derive a future of economic well being! If you have non abusive parents that are willing to pay for your education, then you were born with a treasure of incomparable worth. I cannot stress how valuable this is. Do not casually discard it.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/2552771201862787925'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/2552771201862787925'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html?showComment=1303978090645#c2552771201862787925' title=''/><author><name>Outis</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/14282294685413687573</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110236988653196126' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110236988653196126' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1148786213"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="1:08 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-5696215247402045741</id><published>2011-04-13T22:17:35.942-07:00</published><updated>2011-04-13T22:17:35.942-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I&amp;#39;m  17 yrs old and I come  from a good wealth...</title><content type='html'>I&amp;#39;m  17 yrs old and I come  from a good wealthy family. my parents push me every day and it&amp;#39;s hard  to just say no to them and I just want to leave everything behind. &lt;br /&gt;pointers as to where to go because I have no other family and I kind in a small community and I don&amp;#39;t think they have shelters?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/5696215247402045741'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/110236988653196126/comments/default/5696215247402045741'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html?showComment=1302758255942#c5696215247402045741' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/12/message-to-homeless-teens.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-110236988653196126' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/110236988653196126' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-836465159"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="10:17 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8696619341262323630</id><published>2011-03-29T22:44:24.341-07:00</published><updated>2011-03-29T22:44:24.341-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Living off the land is nowhere near as easy as you...</title><content type='html'>Living off the land is nowhere near as easy as you describe. Unless you already have the skills, surviving is tough. I like to watch a cable show called &lt;i&gt;Survivorman&lt;/i&gt;. In it Les Stroud, a man trained in all sorts of survival skills, goes into all kinds of environments and tries to survive for a week. One thing I notice is that he frequently makes it only by the skin of his teeth, and he nearly always comes out looking much worse for wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#39;s a guy with a production crew ready to step in if he gets in trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&amp;#39;re going to try to live off squirrels and wild greens, that&amp;#39;s okay, but stay close to civilization, so that you can rescue yourself if needed. Passing for a boy is definately a good choice if you can pull it off, but don&amp;#39;t think it is a perfect protection from sexual exploitation. Boys get pimped too. I guess what I am saying is to be resilient. Your methods may work for you, but if they don&amp;#39;t, then change them quick. If a strategy you learn here or elsewhere is not working, then the only expert on how you should try to survive is yourself.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml'

suggestion to anyone who wants to run away or leave home but doesnt have a place to go. go to the woods it would be alot safer than being on the streets not to mention you can forage for food if you need to .just go to a public library look for foraging books. the forest is also a good place to go if you dont want to be found. if you have no money to buy some basic supplies(magnisiam fire starter,knife,tarp,rope ect.a good way to stay warm if you dont have or cant aford a sleeping bag would be to get some garbage bags and stuff them with newspaper you can tape the bags together cut out the bottom of one end and with the newspapers stuffed in sleep in that .always put leaves or newspaper on the ground first if its cold the cold ground will absorb your body heat.I think it would be best for anyone planning on becoming homeless or who gets kicked out or cant stand living in your house or the people you are staying with .look at survival sites for in the wilderness . how to set traps for squirells or rabbits how to make a fire that gives off less smoke so as not to give away your position. edible wild plants. even if you are  planning to stay on the streets it is good to have knowledge in these things incase you get threatened or chased by hasslers on the street and have no choice but to resort to the woods (especially if you a girl) .camping in a fairly large coverage of trees is (in my opinion speaking as a girl)alot safer than being on the streets at night where someone can easily find you.and the sex slave trade is growing larger every day more girls are being snatched off the street so be carful. i have cut my hair short and am planning on binding my chest and dressing like a guy (i would highly suggest the same for other girls ).wearing sunglasses and a cap.i have never tried drugs or booze and never will.i suggest you do the same .when living homeless you want to have a sharp clear mind so you can get out of trouble fast if needed.this fact is doubled when you are under age and dont want to have a run in with the cops .i hope this helped.lol it was quite long</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml'

blog. you provided people a resource to clear up their frustrations. i&amp;#39;d appreciate this blog a lot more though if you acknoledged the teens running away for reasons other than abuse(although i feel you didnt include this because your trying not to encourage teenage homelessness). i am soon to be a runaway teen and if i live through the expierence, i hope to start a site similar to yours except directed to the people who think about being homeless the most whom are teenagers. i wish to converse with any other future runaways about ideas of survival or such, just email me at dizimoto@yahoo.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw i&amp;#39;m 15, male, and i didn&amp;#39;t post my life story because i&amp;#39;m not that selfish. my only point in commenting here is to both compliment the writer and attempt to talk to people in my similar circumstance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and to the people with the negative comments, go spam another site with your fascist

are ways to overcome the threats you&amp;#39;ll almost definitely be faced with. If you crop your hair short and aren&amp;#39;t particularly *ahem* endowed to begin with, it&amp;#39;s surprisingly easy to pass for a guy. Invest in some baggy clothes, avoid talking, and don&amp;#39;t let anyone get close enough to see your face. A friend and I did this for over three months, and were only found out a handful of times.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, we were able to contact my aunt in New Orleans, who&amp;#39;s always wanted daughters and took us in without question. Since then, my friend has made amends with her mother and gone home, and my aunt has enrolled me in an excellent school.&lt;br /&gt;So ladies, if you have any possible means of getting out, utilize them!

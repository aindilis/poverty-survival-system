If you don&amp;#39;t have a laptop or notebook, get one.  A good way to keep cool is hang out at the library and use their WiFi Free electricity to charge your cellphone and you can nap for a couple hours and no one will say boo about it.  Get the library card ASAP.  There are several libraries in my city but the first one I went to denied me a library card because I revealed that I was homeless.  The supervisor gave me a rather insulting explanation that it has to do with the library having residency requirements being that its funded by the taxpayers... but I could have a card for 50 dollars.  I work here and go to school here and that was my first day homeless and they wouldn&amp;#39;t give me a library card.  I just went to another library and didn&amp;#39;t say anything about the address on my license not being a current address and scored a card then.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109941466894130984/comments/default/8829823303469741561'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109941466894130984/comments/default/8829823303469741561'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/keeping-cool.html?showComment=1376353280584#c8829823303469741561' title=''/><author><name>JuJu</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05138674462887414327</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/keeping-cool.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109941466894130984' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109941466894130984' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-822118933"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="5:21 PM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-2875815449608225243</id><published>2013-04-24T01:14:00.042-07:00</published><updated>2013-04-24T01:14:00.042-07:00</updated><title type='text'>I really like your blog and I have to say EVERYONE...</title><content type='html'>I really like your blog and I have to say EVERYONE has great ideas. I was homeless in Hawaii for about 6 months, then lived in 2 places for about 6 years and now will be living homeless again. I have to say I am more prepared for this type of lifestyle than ever. Being homeless in the summer time can be killer, we&amp;#39;d rent a hotel room for a weekend to keep cool and during the weekdays we&amp;#39;d invested in the 5 day cooler (NOW Wal-Mart has a 10 day cooler) we&amp;#39;d fill it up with ICE, packs of bottled water and whatever fruits or meats that would stay help us to stay cool. This eliminated us from having to go to Fast Food all the time. Also we wouldn&amp;#39;t sleep in the same spot everynight. One night we were on one side of the island the other night we slept somewhere else. Also here&amp;#39;s a helpful hint : If you can afford it get a camping permit for the week in Hawaii it&amp;#39;s only $25.00 for the whole week at least you&amp;#39;ll have a shower and restroom and space you can park and sleep or have a tent. I WISH HAWAII WOULD ALLOW RV&amp;#39;S but they DON&amp;#39;T.. I&amp;#39;ll be doing this and yes I like the Library visit during the day and the movies too. Also DON&amp;#39;T forget to utilize the FREE public pools as this has showers and restrooms. Or if you can get a 24 hr fitness, month-to-month membership so at least you can work out during the day, or swim, jacuzzi, &amp;amp; most important SHOWER &amp;amp; RESTROOM in your area. Cheaper route could be the beach or your local YMCA. Ooo well, I hoped this helped as I&amp;#39;ll be doing this. </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109941466894130984/comments/default/2875815449608225243'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109941466894130984/comments/default/2875815449608225243'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/keeping-cool.html?showComment=1366791240042#c2875815449608225243' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/keeping-cool.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109941466894130984' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109941466894130984' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-1520466819"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="1:14 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-151314937162107366</id><published>2012-11-22T06:27:16.788-08:00</published><updated>2012-11-22T06:27:16.788-08:00</updated><title type='text'>11-21-12&#xa;&#xa;When I was a child in the early &amp;#39;70&amp;...</title><content type='html'>11-21-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a child in the early &amp;#39;70&amp;#39;s, when AC was an expensive option for vehicles,that most people didn&amp;#39;t choose to add on, my parents would fill a cooler with ice and leave the cooler open in the back seat footwells. During the heat of the day, it melted fast, of course, but it lasted longer at night and was nice. I&amp;#39;ve used roadside self service ice machines, that will fill a cooler for $2 or less, in the south east US. Wet bandannas or hand towels worn around the neck have helped keep me cool on construction jobs in FL. When they start feeling hot, just swing them through the air a couple of times and evaporation will cool it, again.&lt;br /&gt; If you have a relatively safe spot to place it, a zeer pot will keep foods and beverages10-20 degrees cooler than outdoor temps by utilizing evaporation, as well.&lt;br /&gt; Rocket stoves are a solution to cooking outdoors, with minimal smoke and no need to buy propane tanks. They can be built from scraps or in a pinch made with clay and sand.&lt;br /&gt; If you have a self-built hut or shack in the woods that is dark during the day, you can fill 2 liter bottles with water and a couple capfuls of bleach and wedge them into holes in the roof and caulk around them with sealant or tree sap for daytime interior lighting without wasting batteries, candles or lamp oil.&lt;br /&gt;I know MHM doesn&amp;#39;t approve of smoking, but for those who find quitting just one more reason to be depressed. There are cheap alternatives. Rolling your own. Whether with rolling papers or prefiltered tubes and a small one cigarette machine. You can strip tobacco from butts that you find around bars, restaurants or businesses, after hours. Stripping the butts, instead of smoking them as is, keeps you from catching communicable diseases like hepatitis, tuberculosis, etc. Wash or sanitize your hands well after stripping the tobacco and before rolling your own, though.&lt;br /&gt;If your going to stay in an area long enough to plant and harvest. Then buy a few $1 packets of seeds of your favorite vegetables, fruits or berries and plant a couple here and there just off the marked paths in local parks or empty lots. Granted, wildlife might get to them before you can harvest, but if they don&amp;#39;t then you&amp;#39;ll get back more in food than you spent.&lt;br /&gt; </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109941466894130984/comments/default/151314937162107366'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109941466894130984/comments/default/151314937162107366'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/keeping-cool.html?showComment=1353594436788#c151314937162107366' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/keeping-cool.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109941466894130984' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109941466894130984' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-549328143"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="6:27 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-6914428687530197236</id><published>2012-07-01T21:01:55.172-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-01T21:01:55.172-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Amazing info so far.

Employment is not an option, though it has been attempted.  I lost my grasp and career.  Frequently, I lose myself for days.  This isn&amp;#39;t a blackout, I&amp;#39;m simply not here.   While lucid, I am more than competent at hiding in plain-sight.  Have you met any schizophrenics and are willing to impart any of their survival skills?  I should have predicated this by stating I cannot stay at any location long; compulsory fleeing/agoraphobia.  Humans are psychotic apes.  I miss my momma.  My twin won&amp;#39;t talk to me.  I bought a Droid as my credit is good.  Monthly cost of $125.00.  I came to the desert.  Hydration and shade are paramount.  Population of less than ten thousand; very few humans.  Night sky is beauty defined.  Meteor shower, can&amp;#39;t remember the events name of next couple of nights, can&amp;#39;t remember what the comets name whose trail we are passing through either.  Thank you for any information you can relate and have related.  We&amp;#39;re all alone, but your mother is in your heart.  I forgot where my home is.  She is 62 now.  She used to teach, but retired.  My twin talks to her, but he stopped talking to me.  I know I&amp;#39;m not right, but I just miss him.  They wanted me medicated.  Psychiatrists know nothing.  E.C.T. is barbaric torture.  It burnt my brain to the core.

Any flavor will work and the largest bottle, quart, is a few dollars and can last you months.  Why isn&amp;#39;t Listerine advertising this?  They would own the market overnight, world wide.

These aren&#39;t the kind that rely on ice packs.  They have some kind of gel that stays cool for up to 24 hours.  You do not refrigerate them, but soak them in water in the morning to activate them.  Then you wear them as a tie or a headband.  Some places have packets that are sewn into baseball caps.  I got  a couple this winter to use next summer since I am subject to heat exhaustion, since some friends said these are great.  The site I found is Polar-products.com.

I&#39;d NEVER want to do so again but I am thankful for the experience and grew from it.  It&#39;s amazing what one can learn and I know now what kind of stuff I&#39;m made of.  I was never unemployed but worked as a lab technician making excellent wages.  I just was faced with a series of events which quickly drained my savings and ended up losing my apartment and was unable to get back on my own feet for awhile.  I was also blessed that I had a car to live in and as such I never considered myself truly homeless as I had a roof over my head which is more than some could say, and that roof belonged to me.  I joked with friends telling them my license plate number as my address.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Summers in a car can be stifling hot and miserable and I found a trick to help me out in that regard.  Peppermint oil!  A very small bottle can cost about $6-7 but it only takes a few drops.  I applied a drop to my forehead, the back of my neck, chest, the small of my back and behind my thighs and in a matter of seconds, it felt like I had my own personal air conditioning system.  I still perspired, but the chilling sensation allowed me enough respite to fall asleep comfortably.  A word of warning though: TEST IT FIRST.  I found out the hard way that SOME people are sensitive to it and instead of chilling them, they feel an uncomfortable burning and iritation.  I suggested it to a friend once and it was a mistake.  The best thing to do is just try a diluted (with cooking oil)drop to a less-than-sensitive portion of skin (the back of the arm for instance) and wait to see if there is a reaction.  For those who aren&#39;t senisitive to it, I hope this helps.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109941466894130984/comments/default/715617370940174616'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/109941466894130984/comments/default/715617370940174616'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/keeping-cool.html?showComment=1211298180000#c715617370940174616' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/11/keeping-cool.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-109941466894130984' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8752543/posts/default/109941466894130984' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-152740699"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="8:43 AM"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8752543.post-8541834346709475414</id><published>2008-05-11T02:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-11T02:20:00.000-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Real RV&#39;s have a vent in the top you can open to l...</title><content type='html'>Real RV&#39;s have a vent in the top you can open to let the heat out.&lt;BR/&gt;The drill is that first thing in the morning you open this, which makes it just a little chilly, and then at sundown you close it.&lt;BR/&gt;Don&#39;t know what you could home-make.

I am not homeless, but after 30 years of living in FL you learn what keeps those little buggers away. When ever we have an outdoor BBQ we hang dryers sheets on the rail of the deck. They can be used to freshen up your clothes, keep your car smelling nice, reduce static electricity, eliminate odor in your shoes, get baked on grease of of that old pot, etc. You can get a box of 40 at Dollar Tree.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;On the same note the best way to get rid of the itch of a bug bite (mosquito, ants, bee stings, etc) is to dab a bit of deoderant on the wound. The itch will be gone in seconds and the red swelling disappears fast too. I always keep some in my car for the kids.

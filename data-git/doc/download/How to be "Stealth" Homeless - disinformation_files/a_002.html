<p>Having done much of this, I'd also throw in that if you have any 
research universities around, they often will pay for being a human 
subject for various experiments, often VERY simple psychology 
experiments (generally, reacting to stimuli on a computer screen).  And 
if you're crafty, of course you could maintain a presence on sites like 
Etsy.  Nobody thinks twice about a business mailing address being a PO 
Box...</p><p>ALSO: GET A LIBRARY CARD IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE ONE.  
Crucial.  Internet, and plenty of reading material for when you're 
bored, and would rather not just end up hanging out with other homeless 
people.  Many big cities have comic books in the library stacks...so 
much the better.</p><p>And while you're at it on the Internet, it may be
 handy to get a shell account (yes, they still exist), or even a VPS 
(such as the free ones from Amazon, or paid in a variety of places).  
While you can't, say, run bittorrent on a library computer, you can onto
 a VPS, and then simply sftp it to the library computer, and onto a 
portable device such as an mp3 player.  Meanwhile, the shell access 
should double as a solid SSH socks proxy tunnel, thus bypassing any 
firewall restrictions you may encounter.  You'd be surprised at some of 
what libraries tend to firewall.</p><p>As for storage, geocaching can be
 handy here.  Ammo cans and other storage containers are available 
cheaply at surplus stores, and many fairly cheap mobile devices tend to 
have GPS capability these days.  Heading out to the woods, if you have 
some available, and burying an ammo can, keeping the GPS coordinates 
stored somewhere, allows for retrievability and eases up on restrictions
 placed on how much stuff you can have that tend to occur naturally with
 a nomadic lifestyle.  Good for storing a few week's worth of preserved 
food at the very least...frankly, not a bad idea even if you HAVE a 
home, just in case of emergencies.</p><p>And if you're aiming for lots 
of internet use, it's best to be in an area with a lot of free or easily
 accessible wifi access, and to NOT bother with 3g/4g service.  Handle 
any long downloading over the shell account, and then just grab it next 
time you connect.  The money you save here can be fairly sizeable.  To 
go further with savings, cut off the phone entirely, after setting up 
google voice, and simply respond to voicemails, rather than ever 
answering calls in real time.  People are fairly used to not having 
calls answered these days in most areas, so if this is feasible, it's 
another expense saved.  It IS worth having a Go phone for emergency 
purposes however, which can be acquired for $10 with ~100 minutes 
included.</p><p>Anyway, good writeup, just figured I'd add in a few more ideas to help!</p>

<p>The first time I read this article, I was thinking "hmm interesting 
info that I will probably never need".  That night, my landlord called 
to let me know that I had to move out by December.  I am not in any kind
 of financial situation to move and I certainly don't have the deposit 
most places require, but I bet if I can keep my business rolling for a 
couple of months while I go homeless, I can make it happen.  Thanks for 
the article.</p>

<p>Keeping the car helps a lot especially when you go to job interviews,
 also stockpiling as much stuff in your trunk as possible like food and 
extra shoes I was "homeless" for 6 months.Also switching all your 
statements to paperless you can go to the library for free to check 
up.It was a depressing time, I applied for food stamps and didn't say I 
was homeless and they denied me but live and learn.</p>

<p>How about banks? How do you maintain and/or open bank account if you 
have some cash to store in? They need a residential address. One option 
is to borrow a friend's address just to maintain your bank account and 
other things as well.</p>

<p>That's why people who may not be completely "homeless" are told to 
put that on the application anyway, just so they GET the darn things. If
 you're in a battered womens' shelter, for instance, even though you're 
getting 2 meals a day every day you put "homeless" anyway so you GET the
 darn things. They roll over and they don't expire.</p><p>To illustrate:
 without mentioning the city, I will say that one medium-sized city has a
 tick-box on its application for "homeless" and if you tick that box, 
(this is the online application) the areas for address "grey-out" and 
what happens after you submit the thing is that you get notified somehow
 to come to the office and pick up the card. It's during the telephone 
interview...which you can have done at the number of a local shelter or 
drop-in or day center.</p><p>Again without giving away the exact 
location it bears mentioning that in the jurisdictions I'm thinking of, 
by their laws of "what constitutes homelessness" anything less than a 
year-long lease in YOUR name on an apartment or a house, constitutes 
"homeless." Even renting a room month-to-month, constitutes "homeless." 
Couch-surfing is "homeless." Residing in a battered womens' shelter, 
constitutes "homeless." </p>

<p>I went "homeless" for a year in 06, but not really in my humility.  I
 had a minivan that held a twin mattress in the back perfectly.  Also, I
 was renting a storage/business bay at a warehouse facility to store my 
tools and household stuff.  I was working as a handyman pt, had a one 
day a week labor job and a cell phone bill with gas and insurance on the
 van.  I set up the storage unit as an apartment like, with a used 
fridge I got off craigslist, a microwave, toaster oven and hot plate.  <br>Set
 up my desktop computer, tv and bed in the back behind a temp wall made 
of salvaged wood, even found an a/c unit since the electric was included
 in the rent.  only problem was I couldn't sleep there, so getting a 
decent night sleep was hard, but it happened.</p><p>I say not homeless 
cause of all this because it wasn't out in the woods with a tent, much 
different.  It was actually very comfortable at times when the weather 
in Florida wasn't too hot.  Just working out a place for my dog to stay 
while doing handywork was hard and places to park and sleep was 
shameless.  Luckily when the cops would stop and check me out at 3am 
cause of the dog prairie-doggin the front seat of the van, they were 
pretty understanding of the situation.  No arrests just one out of ten 
times did the cop threaten to run me out of town, fascist that he was.  
After a year I found a job and moved into a temp house, but lost the job
 after 90days cause the first two weeks until the house opened up, I had
 the dog with my at work in the van.  That iced it for the beotch anal 
retentive owners wife/mother.  I almost went back to the storage unit as
 it was still rented, but I had found a girlfriend that was getting 
divorced and we moved in together.  Five years down the road and four 
jobs and two business failures later and I am ready to go back just to 
get away from the witch.  Storage is full at the cheap rent place and 
everything else is too much to afford since I don't have the van anymore
 to sleep in, and now the dog is getting old and needs more comfortable 
digs.  Can't carry him around on a scooter that I have now.  Can't give 
him up either, if it weren't for his love, there would have been none 
these last few years. Having the dog is one of the reasons I couldn't 
find a cheap place to live since everybody charges pet deposit and extra
 rent here in Florida.  This state sucks in almost everyway except the 
warm weather in the winter.  Only a few days near freezing each year if 
lucky and the rest of the season is great, but summer seems endless.   
Luckily, the storage was near a trailer park that gave covert access to a
 pool, hot tub and showers with coin op laundry.  Things worked out well
 also being near the beach as there were showers there also.  So it was 
great on one hand that for a couple two or three day of part time work 
kept me in a pretty luxurious "homeless" situation, but it wasn't ideal 
living at all.  But food from the pantries, an all you can eat buffet 
would fill my belly for the day if I went mid afternoon before the 
evening rate kicked in and cheap food from the kitchenette at storage 
was great.  Storage was midtown so the beach the shower/laundry and work
 were close by. Actually sounds great compared to the grief of being 
under this bitches thumb since she is the employed breadwinner of the 
house.  (btw...she would never be where she is if not for me getting her
 into the habitat home, finding free insulin for her diabetes and 
keeping her son fed and from failing out of school like he was under her
 master plan. but that is a whole other diatribe)<br>Great article, it 
is encouraging me to step out again to make things better, like out of 
the frying pan into the fire.  But freedom is precious, and change is 
inevitable and good to embrace.  Just hard to give up comfort and 
stability when it is working out even a small part of the time...best 
wishes and God's blessing to all who find themselves struggling to make a
 life in this troubled time.  Jesus Christ, be our guide, our light and 
our provider, keep us safe and free from tyranny and disease of all 
kinds. Fill our hearts with love that overcomes the world and come back 
soon to clean up these evil banksters and politicians.  We need you now,
 Lord, in your father's will I pray amen.</p>

<p>Very much appreciate this. I am a musician ("busker") and was 
traveling around and living just like you detailed in your article for 6
 months.<br> It is completely doable, having a nomadic lifestyle if you stay right and don't get caught or involved with anyone stupid.</p><p>I
 am currently at the parents house, for want of "doing things right" and
 it is difficult to do when you're called to that nomadic lifestyle.<br>
 There is most certainly and sustainably a way to do it that isn't 
buying into all the bullshit that people have become accustomed to 
needing these days. (as in: STUFF, STUFF,STATUS,STUFF,STATUS,STUFF!)</p><p>It
 is a battle to do things the way everyone else does them, when you just
 know it's not right and not for you.. hard work and payoff aren't bad 
at all, and it should not be equated with laziness to be "homeless". As 
long as you are taking care of yourself and not mooching off of other 
people.<br>It isn't "homeless" it is "Houseless", as everywhere is home, and what better a thought than that??</p><p>"Anywhere I want to be, anywhere I want to go, Everywhere and everyone for me is HOME."<br>Thank you, Ted... for reminding me.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's awesome that you have musical talent. I really wish I 
did. I've hung out with some "travellers" which is kind of its own 
subculture. Maybe I should write about them some time. You probably know
 who I am talking about, often people with dreads, home made leather 
clothing, often dogs. I try to be discerning, because just like everyone
 else there is good and bad.</p><p>I prefer a more intellectual crowd, 
it makes for better conversations when passing a bowl around! Some of 
these people are deep! I was talking to the one dude that knew all about
 the finer points of train hopping and then we started talking about 
Greek mythology and the Illiad, then somehow the conversation drifted to
 cephalopods. I spent a weekend hanging out with some dudes camping in 
the woods that had a van and were traveling around the country. All 
awesome musicians. Three guitar players, a violinist and a drummer.</p><p>I
 learned some petty scams from this crowd, but decided not to include 
that because I don't do them as a general rule. I was so good at it I 
decided I didn't want to do that. I just tried a couple for the 
experience. But it taught me that if my back was against the wall I can 
talk my way out of almost anything. My goal is not to be a con artist 
though. After I did a scam, I got ripped off a few days later and 
figured it was Karma catching up to me! I didn't even get mad!</p>

re-reading this over time. This article - gritty, pragmatic,

<p>I worked at a bank.  You can update the address to anything you want.
  If you do paperless statements, the only mail you get is overcharge 
notices and renewal debit/atm cards anyway. If you walk into a branch 
and do it in person, I don't think the teller system is even capable of 
checking to see if the address is real.  It's also possible to send 
cards directly to the branch for pickup if you ask very nicely.</p>

<p>A lot of this info is good, but some of it is stupid bullshit. I 
personally know a few people who are homeless that aren't allowed get 
foodstamps and are actually panhandling on the streets so that they can 
eat. I've had them spend some nights at my place, but I can't afford to 
keep them all the time.</p><p>Some of the stuff said in this would just 
make people hate the homeless, or to look down on them. Whoever wrote 
this needs to re-evaluate themselves.</p>

<p>Yes, we need to clarify that only SOME STATES will allow homeless 
people to get food stamps. MOST STATES require a physical street address
 and so many "proofs" of it that you wonder if you're applying for a job
 with the F.B.I or something....</p>

<p>It depends if it is a red state or not. Arizona gives you the run around for sure.</p><p>I
 applied for Medicaid through AZ because of my unemployment. I check my 
status on the online system and it says I don't exist, but when I apply 
again it says I can't cause I do exist?!?</p><p>No email to contact them so I call..</p><p>I WAS ON FOR HOURS AND THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE!</p><p>There
 is no place to go in person. Only some third party company that matches
 you with insurance options (i think only a few actually use medicaid) 
so they say they can't help me. WTF?</p><p>I left the state a few months
 later so I let the issue drop. But seriously, the federal government 
needs to sue AZ for breaking federal law by not providing medicaid to 
its citizens in an adequate matter!</p><p>EDIT: And I'm taxpaying 
citizen who did all the red tape stuff they ask when I had money coming 
in. A freaking boy scout all the way. And when I needed help they just 
give me the finger. Now I have to pay more taxes when I don't have an 
income because I couldn't sign up for medicare on time even though I 
applied early. SCREW THEM! And their sick republican games they play.</p><p>I don't care if you stupid republicans don't like Obamacare IT'S THE LAW!</p><p>P.S.
 I doesn't matter to me anymore, but if anyone has information on how to
 get in contact someone in AZ about medicaid (especially face-to-face), 
it might help someone searching on the internet in the same situation I 
was.</p><p>Okay, I feel better now ;)</p>

<p>Rent is fucking expensive.  And losing a job without any savings can 
be brutal.  Typically moving into a standard lease requires three 
months' rent on hand.  This stuff isn't bad advice.</p><p>This sounds 
like Portland--Labor Ready, plasma clinics.  Wasn't 'homeless' but I've 
done both of those.  I have a kid--not gonna do outdoors with a 
toddler--so I was shelling out $40 of my $$60 daily take from LR on 
hotel rooms for a little while last summer.  That was brutal, but 
eventually I found a Craigslister who let me rent out a living room for 
$65 a week.</p>

<p>No, actually in some parts of the country everything on Craigslist is
 still demanding credit and reference checks and income/employment 
verification. Yes, to rent ROOMS. In most of the parts of the country 
I'VE been to these past few years, it seems that not even the fact that 
you can still write them a check that won't bounce (i.e. proof you still
 have a checking account, stupid people!) is enough to dispense with the
 credit-check nonsense.</p>

<p>So I'm writing this in 2016, as an apartment property manager. Do not
 EVER allow yourself to be evicted. PERIOD.  You will never, ever be 
able to rent again with an eviction on your record. If you know you 
can't pay the rent, give notice - even if it's not thirty days, and get 
the hell out of the apt. DON'T SKIP OUT!!!  You will be dooming yourself
 to homelessness forever. There is currently a huge affordable housing 
crisis in this country, and even employed, middle class folks can't find
 a place to live. I manage the lowest rent building in the worst part of
 town (Portland, OR suburb) and the rental criteria is that you make 2.5
 times the rent monthly (with 6 months pay stubs to prove it) and have 
good credit. As the paid manager of the building, I would NOT qualify to
 rent in my own (crappy, mold filled) building! It is FATAL advice to 
allude to saying someone should just stop paying rent. If you do that, 
without giving notice, and with rent owed, no one will rent to you, 
EVER.<br></p>

<p>Homelessness sucks lol the funny thing is I started a business while I
 was homeless. It's funny all the excuses I made while I had all the 
resources to build a business I kept making excuses then I became 
homeless and a lot of things I said were impossible became possible like
 really easy too easy I say. When u need ur mind goes into over drive 
and becomes smarter in an attempt to find a solution to the number one 
problem. I cane up with ideas and plans and solutions and did them out 
and I did things I was afraid to do I just did them I had nothing to 
lose. Since I had nothing the only direction I could possibly go was up.</p>

<p>Been there and did that. Age 21 then. We were the cleanest looking 
homeless folk you ever saw. My clique and I worked odd jobs, camped out 
when we didn't have a crash pad, bathed in lakes and streams, did our 
other ablutions in gas station rest rooms and generally knew every way 
to squeeze a dollar until it could slice atoms. Homelessness doesn't 
have to be a complete train wreck...and recovery is way easier when you 
still have a vestige of your sh*t together and can segue back into grid 
life at the first opportunity. In my case it was getting three jobs one 
after another, mostly thru false address info and very good first 
interviews, then working 60+hrs a week until I piled up enough cash to 
afford deposit and first months rent. That portable alarm clock was my 
best friend...but it helped that I slept light in those days. Good guide
 full of useful info. I highly approve.</p>

<p>"Prove it" as in just put something down? Yes. IME experience they 
don't give that much of a shit. Your experience may vary. I would just 
pick a random house # nearby, or your former residence. Worked for me 
three times in different places. Obviously don't just say "OH, I'm 
homeless." but that might actually work.</p><p>Some Homeless shelters let you get mail there. But the Plasma centers know these addresses and reject them. </p>

<p>I work at the P O :(  and now we make everyone show us a document 
that "proves" their physical address (see above) but I believe some PO's
 are probably lax about it. Our boss just happens to be pretty strict @ 
rule following. That said, we also hand out blank lease forms and tell 
people to go have their landlord fill it out/sign it. It could be anyone
 filling it out....... I won't even go into the whole "book rate" thing 
tho.</p>

<p>Yeah leases are the easiest thing in the world to fake. I mean, 
usually the lease the leasee has is a bad photocopy anyway - just white 
out the expired date of your last one and put in a date a year in the 
future and copy it again on a Library copy machine. Voila. You have a 
lease.</p><p>I never got why anyone would consider this proof of anything at all.</p>

<p>Some of us out here know all about the blank lease forms and what 
constitutes a "book" for "book rate." I mean, it's not like they X-ray 
the package or anything....in one medium-sized city I know, the post 
office which they call the "General Delivery Post Office" lets people 
rent a PO Box without checking more than one piece of I.D. or at least 
they did back as recently as 2008....of course the problem with that is 
that only Outsiders don't know which Post Office that is by the ZIP Code
 on your P.O. Box....</p>

<p>help world i tried everything to help myself im here because im going <br>homeless looking for a place to call home with a job to support my own <br>home some were down south were there is no snow and place with talented <br>people in music i no friends my family abandoned me when i was 18 and i <br>never seen my father only thing i no about him is his name but i no <br>because my mother told me and im searching for my wife i just want to <br>let you no who ever you are im thinking of you wife and i love you and i<br> no you will come first when we meet and i want to be with you even <br>though i don't no you yet im trapped in this lifestyle and trying to run<br> from it if i have to do this and face it and not stay i wont see life so i have to do this to start<br>
 a new one im a good person that was adapt to this and i dont want to 
and tried so hard to have good life the fail was from my family like 
this going <br>homeless i never asked for it and i don't like it and im scared not of <br>dieing but of my future and the future it holds for me how much more <br>longer will i have to live like this because im doing it alone i have <br>no real long friends no true family and im 23 who ever sees this if you <br>go through what i have your not alone if your standing on this topic like me it is a true story of mine and <br>30 years from now i hope im next to my wife in a real home not dead or <br>still homeless i want help and want to change out of this evil hole im <br>in i hope everyone blogs this every were because im printing it and <br>stapling  in my homeless travels to find hope and a new start of life if<br> i am alive at the end of the tunnel and breathing fresh air and not <br>there wife im sorry if i failed the pain i was in is for no real man or any person who <br>had a heart to bare mine was destroyed in my teen age years but how i cope <br>with this is i play music my message to the whole world im sorry world i <br>dont no what i did wrong to go homeless so hard to find the love of my <br>wife
 i hope your ok  i want to be forgotten because i want to be forgotten 
my family treats me that way ever since i was born p.s this was posted 
on 3/29/2016.and i was born 12/15/92 at the time of 3:00pm i want to 
leave earth will the world let me leave in space and allow me to try and
 find more life with a ship that i can leave on from which can handle 
all cosmetic ray's asteroids and any other things space related if i die
 i want to die my way and its to do something positive like this for 
humanity is skill but it take guts less of a brain when subjected to new
 research is found of new life i dont like earth i cant adapt to the 
people leaving and doing there own thing around me mine is away from 
earth the unknown new discovery we now to much about earth and it's seas
 we dont no much about space i want to help with my ideas to help push 
them forward and further in space to drive and live with speed a longer 
distance to find more life but question is why do you stay if you want 
to reach to find what no person cant but you are still opened to try it 
out if i find life it does not mean you missed out it just means you 
were not close or far from it there is no such thing as a end because 
were people begin people can mistake as it being the end well mine is 
the other way around why because the bigger picture is bigger than us 
all space we hold is not bigger so were is the real answer well its us 
how far do you want to go i want to go far i want to explore and not 
adapt to one world i want to find more and maybe my own even though i am
 human after what can i do and yes i have a ship blue print called space
 dog there is a reason for it and that name will carry on if you want to
 no more im the creator of this ship them astronaut rockets throw them 
away mine is better just my back yard called earth is not big to build 
no joke i no how to build and have it turn on with oxygen and even grow 
plants<br>but world when will we start looking for the answers of why we are here im just going to do that with out you if you dont.</p>

<p>How about banks? How do you maintain and/or open bank account if you 
have some cash to store in? They need a residential address. One option 
is to borrow a friend's address just to maintain your bank account and 
other things as well. This is the part I was wondering about.</p>

<p>Be more useful if there was a guide to how to be homeless while 
severely disabled,on a fistful of meds twice a day, unable to carry more
 than a few pounds,unable to walk more than a few feet before having to 
stop and rest during the winter and unable to eat 'normal' foods. (the 
one and only thing that doesn't taste like filth is not sold in stores 
or online due to it being labeled 'unfit for human consumption')</p>

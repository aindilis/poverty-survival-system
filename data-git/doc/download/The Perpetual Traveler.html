By <a href="http://glenn-campbell.com/">Glenn Campbell</a>, June 15, 2015<br>
<br>
I love <a href="http://hostelworld.com/">HostelWorld.com</a>. It has 
opened the world to me more than any other tool apart from the airplane.
 Whenever I travel to a new city, this website means I can find a safe, 
comfortable place to sleep, endorsed by the reviews of previous guests.<br>
<br>
But what happens when those guests aren't real? In the course of my 
planning for a round-the-world trip, I stumbled on a hostel operator in 
Dubai<b> who has fabricated at least 39 positive reviews for his properties</b>,
 obviously attempting to counteract his many negative reviews. 
Generating fake reviews is easy enough to do: You just create a bogus 
account on HostelWorld, make a reservation for your property, then leave
 a review after the reservation date has passed. (You pay a reservation 
fee but don't have to pay for the bed.)<br>
<br>
Check out the hostels in question (2 in Dubai and 1 in Minsk) and look carefully at the reviews.<br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/EasyFlat-12-Dubai-Hostel/Dubai/85860">EasyFlat 12 Dubai Hostel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/BackPacker-Hostel/Dubai/91171">BackPacker Hostel Dubai</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Hostel-EasyFlat/Minsk/84777">Hostel EasyFlat Minsk</a></li>
</ul>
<div>
<br></div>
Notice that all of the positive reviews are from "Novice Nomads" whose 
only activity on HostelWorld consists of glowing reviews of these three 
properties. Each of these reviewers has changed their nationality, 
sometimes their language and even their gender in the course of writing 
superlative reviews each of these properties and no others. All of these
 reviews are in the 85% to 100% range.<br>
<br>
Most of the reviews from experienced travelers are poor. Here is one offering a 34% rating....<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>There is no facilities at all and the toilet is extremely dirty and 
disorganized. The place is an "office" in a commercial building with 5 
bunk beds, one toilet and one sink. There is a small round table for 
four people and a wardrobe.</i></blockquote>
I count seven dubious Novice Nomads who have each left reviews for only these three properties. Here they are: <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/profile/16492839/reviews">User1</a>, <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/profile/16492801/reviews">User2</a>, <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/profile/16492824/reviews">User3</a>, <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/profile/16492774/reviews">User4</a>, <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/profile/16517636/reviews">User5</a>, <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/profile/16517623/reviews">User6</a>, <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/profile/16532540/reviews">User7</a>, How likely is it that one person, new to hosteling, would just <i>happen </i>to stay at all three hostels from the same operator? Furthermore <i>their nationality changes in each review</i>. How likely is is that one person would stay at all three hostels <i>and </i>change
 their nationality twice? There are 9 more Novice Nomads who reviewed 
only the two Dubai hostels while switching nationalities. All the 
positive reviewers are "Anonymous", whereas many of the negative reviews
 are not.<br>
<br>
One <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/profile/16532540/reviews">reviewer</a>
 not only changed their nationality (from Norway to Czech Republic to 
Canada) but also changed their gender.... (See review at top and click 
to enlarge)<br>
<br>
The value of HostelWorld depends entirely on the veracity of their user 
reviews. My faith in their system has been shaken because they have 
taken no action more than two weeks after I first alerted them. In that 
time, at lot of innocent travelers have been seduced by an fraud 
facilitated by HostelWorld. It seems they are not really committed to 
keeping reviews honest.<br>
<br>
My two emails to HostelWorld received replies but no action. When I 
first emailed on May 24, 2015. Alejandro at HostelWorld wrote: "We will 
appreciate your feedback and we will look into this matter internally in
 order to clarify if there is any sort of issue."<br>
<br>
Two days later (May 27), I emailed&nbsp;Alejandro&nbsp;links to all 16 
of the fake reviewers I identified (Novice Nomads&nbsp;who reviewed more
 than one of the properties and no others). He wrote back: "We are 
investigating this issue directly with the hostel in order to clarify if
 there was any sort of irregularity."<br>
<br>
It is now June 15. In the meantime, dozens of innocent traveler have 
probably been booking these hostels thinking the ratings are higher than
 they really are. What sort of investigation is needed? At least 39 
reviews are provably fake, and dozens more are suspicious (Novice Nomads
 who have produced only one review). How long does HostelWorld need?<br>
<br>
I can't see the necessity to "clarify with the hostel" when their 
reviews are physically impossible (like the reviewer changing both their
 nationality and gender).. What kind of clarity can be expected?<br>
<br>
I have now doubt that these phony hostels will eventually be removed 
from HostelWorld, especially if I keep harassing them about it. The real
 question now is how long it will take. Here we have overwhelming 
evidence of fraud by an operator who isn't very bright. If HostelWorld 
can't act quickly on this one, you begin to question every hostel 
listing.<br>
<br>
When HostelWorld finally does remove these hostel listings, what is 
going to happen to people who have already booked these hostels. Are 
they going to arrive in Dubai to a hostel that isn't what it claims to 
be or that might not even exist? Will they be informed of the fraud?<br>
<br>
My own solution: I booked a regular hotel on Expedia for only about $10 more.<br>
<b><br></b>
<b>MORE EVIDENCE - June 20, 2015</b><br>
<br>
Looking through the <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/EasyFlat-12-Dubai-Hostel/Dubai/85860/reviews">reviews for Easyflat 12 Dubai</a>, I find some interesting new data. Here are the latest reviews to date, which are pretty dismal. (Click to enlarge.)<br>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qkzUa3yi5HI/VYVxWyRRtiI/AAAAAAAAJMk/v_2nY1Nzn4Y/s1600/Easy%2BFlat%2Bbad%2Breviews.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="The%20Perpetual%20Traveler_files/EasyFlatbadreviews.jpg" border="0" height="328" width="400"></a></div>
<br>
But scrolling down one page, here are the reviews right after the 71% one...<br>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UUCdCzCHccg/VYVx-KHCJ_I/AAAAAAAAJMs/0hsZe57GefA/s1600/Easyflat%2BGood%2BReviews.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="The%20Perpetual%20Traveler_files/EasyflatGoodReviews.jpg" border="0" height="325" width="400"></a></div>
<br>
All in the 97-100% range! There is a series of 6 reviews like this, all 
from people who supposedly stayed at the hostel between March 15 and 
March 17, 2015, then it's back to the dismal reviews again, spread over a
 wider range of time.<br>
<br>
Those six glowing reviews are from Novice Nomads with only one review 
each. That means they aren't even counted in my official tally of 39 
verified fakes. (I can't <i>prove</i> they are fake, but they are certainly suspicious.)<br>
<br>
Reading the authentic reviews is quite enlightening. The owner is said 
to have five apartments. He is regarded as a nice guy, but he is clearly
 in over his head.<br>

A least one of the videos I shot during the Istanbul Gezi Park protests 
in 2013 now appears in a German documentary available online.<br>
<br>
The documentary, in German, is <a href="http://dbate.de/videos/mein-leben-unter-erdogan-videotagebuch-aus-istanbul-13/"><i>Mein Leben unter Erdogan</i></a> (<i>My Life Under Erdogan</i>).
 The 3-part program consists mainly of Skype interviews with 
participants in the protest. I haven't located my own footage yet, but 
it is probably shots of the peaceful parts of the protest on June 6.<br>
<br>
My original video was <a href="https://youtu.be/Z_21Q5UvuLA">Turkish Woodstock</a>,
 a 16-minute video taken June 6, 2015. I also experienced the joy of 
teargas on June 15 in this 9-minute video during the crackdown: <a href="http://youtu.be/2B7qy3tMPz8">Teargas for Everyone</a>.<br>
<br>
My still photos from the protest are in several albums, starting with <a href="http://glenn-campbell.com/detail/gezi">Gezi Park</a>. Other albums are found in my <a href="http://glenn-campbell.com/detail/turkey">Istanbul Index</a>.<br>
<br>
I'm glad I could be of assistance to real journalists.<br>

By <a href="http://glenn-campbell.com/">Glenn Campbell</a>, Sept. 5, 2014<br>
<br>
When I travel, I don't go looking for trouble. I am deeply concerned 
about my own safety. I may visit places like Kosovo and Bosnia that were
 <i>once </i>dangerous, but I'm careful to avoid active war zones and places my government <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html">advises me not to go</a>. I would never go anywhere near the Syrian conflict, but I have been to <a href="http://facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4733586129937.2177810.1003315385&amp;l=2c9cfb0e65">Istanbul </a>several times, and on one of these trips, I encountered an American who was heading there to fight.<br>
<br>
In November 2012, in a hostel in Istanbul, I met an American military veteran named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Harroun">Eric Harroun</a>,
 who was heading to Syria to fight against the forces of Assad in Syria.
 I happened to share a hostel bunkroom with him, and he became&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/eric.harroun">my Facebook friend</a>. &nbsp;Eric is deceased now, but not from anything that happened in Syria. He died of a <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/10/american-jihadist-who-fought-in-syria-dies-of-an-overdose-in-arizona.html">drug overdose</a> in Arizona in April 2014. While the <i>manner </i>of his death was unexpected, the <i>fact </i>of
 his death did not surprise me at all. I knew it was coming from the day
 I met him. Now that it has actually come to pass, I want to tell you 
why I believed his days were numbered.<br>
<br>
There has been plenty written about Eric <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?q=eric+harroun#q=eric+harroun">on the web</a>&nbsp;(including an article in the<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/world/eric-harroun-who-fought-with-syrian-rebels-loses-a-court-fight.html">New York Times</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Harroun">Wikipedia entry</a>), but all of the articles I have seen have neglected a key fact: He was profoundly brain damaged.<br>
<br>
Eric was a US Army veteran during the early era of the Iraq/Afghanistan wars, but according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Harroun">Wikipedia</a>,
 he never saw combat: "He was discharged after a jeep crash at his base 
in Fort Riley, Kansas, which left him with a serious head injury, 
resulting in a metal plate being inserted into his head by doctors" 
(apparently in 2003). This is consistent with what he told me in 
Istanbul.<br>
<br>
Here is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10203151021284871">Facebook video of Eric</a> taken by another guest at the hostel. You can see the scar from his brain surgery, and you can gauge his general frame of mind.<br>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10203151021284871" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" src="The%20Perpetual%20Traveler_files/EricHaroun.jpg" title="Eric Harroun in a Facebook video" border="0" height="362" width="400"></a></div>
<br>
It was obvious to me that Eric was mentally disabled. You couldn't tell 
it from the outside, but if you spent a little time with him, you could 
see how skewed his judgment was, even in a relatively safe place like 
Istanbul. We shared a bunkroom at <a href="http://facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10200917135102974.1073741899.1003315385&amp;l=4b8d241c55">the hostel</a>
 for at least a week, during which time he exhibited numerous lapses of 
judgment in normal everyday tasks, like navigating the city. His brain 
just didn't work right.<br>
Eric spoke Arabic. I asked him how he learned it, and he said his father
 came from an Arabic country. (I don't recall; Lebanon perhaps?) I don't
 know how much of the language he learned from his father and how much 
he learned later, but obviously having a parent who knows a foreign 
language gives you a running start. In Eric's case, I think speaking 
Arabic was a very dangerous thing. It gave him a pass to visit all the 
danger zones of the Middle East, and his brain injury meant he had no 
critical judgment holding him back.<br>
<br>
In short, <i>there was not an ounce of common sense in that boy</i>. In 
heading for Syria, he had no clear idea what he was fighting for or 
against. He seemed to have little grasp of the factional nature of the 
Assad opposition. I think he was seeking out an adrenaline thrill but 
had none of the critical thinking skills or self-preservation instincts 
that keep any normal thrill-seeker alive.<br>
<br>
My very first memory of him was in the hostel common area one afternoon 
(somewhere around Nov. 27, 2012). He had just come in from the streets 
of Istanbul after an hours-long expedition, and he was describing the 
ordeal he had gone through. He was trying to find an address in 
Istanbul. According to his own account, he kept asking people for 
directions, but he spoke to them in Arabic. He would have been much 
better using English. People said, "We don't speak Arabic here. We speak
 Turkish." It was incomprehensible to Eric that a Muslim country would 
not speak Arabic, so he kept using it. Eric eventually found the address
 he was looking for, but it took him many times longer than it would 
take anyone else.<br>
<br>
At this point, I had no idea about his Syrian aspirations. I was only 
thinking, "What a jerk!" I had seen it many times: One of my fellow 
countrymen making a fool of himself in a foreign country. Some people 
should never be given passports because they only get themselves in 
trouble overseas, and I pegged Eric as one of them. Nonetheless, our 
relationship from that point on was friendly.<br>
<br>
A few hours later, we were in the bunkroom together, exchanging the 
usual pleasantries—Where are you from? Where are you going? etc. That 
was when he told me about his plans to go to Syria to fight Assad. I was
 aghast! Here was a guy who couldn't even navigate the streets of a 
"safe" city, and he was heading into a war zone where nothing is clear. 
At this point, the Syrian Civil War had been going on for a year and a 
half, and things were already messy. There were factions fighting Assad 
who couldn't be regarded as any better (what we now know as "ISIS").<br>
<br>
Eric was completely unable to grasp any nuance in the conflict. To him, 
things were black and white: Assad was bad, and anyone opposed to Assad 
was good. As I learned about his brain injury, I began to see that his 
lack of nuance judgment was probably organic. Some part his brain's 
higher functions had been damaged. It might have been an interesting 
case for Dr. Oliver Sacks to study, but in these circumstances I quickly
 saw that his disability would inevitably lead to death.<br>
<br>
Eric and I were roommates for a little more than a week, so I got to 
know him fairly well. He told me about his previous visits to Egypt 
during their unrest. I had been to Egypt, too—during a lull in the 
storm—but even in a period of relative peace, the country frightened me.
 Eric had been deliberately diving into the most dangerous protests, 
with no regard for his own safety. One of the people he met in Egypt was
 now fighting in Syria, and Eric planned to hook up with him at the 
border. I can't remember why Eric was staying so long in Istanbul, but 
it may have been related to difficulties in contacting that person. 
According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Harroun#Activities_in_Syria">Wikipedia</a>,
 Eric crossed into Syria on Jan 7, 2013, about 6 weeks after I met him, 
and was already in trouble three days later, separated from his unit and
 apparently as lost as he was on the streets of Istanbul.<br>
<br>
Things got interesting when I told Eric I had been to Israel several 
times. You could tell he had trouble processing this, since it was 
neither black nor white. In his simple world-view, anyone who had 
anything to do with Israel was automatically the enemy. His brain 
couldn't differentiate any subtleties within a category. On the other 
hand, I was an American, standing right in front of him, obviously not a
 threat. I pointed out that I had also visited Palestine and Egypt and 
that visiting Israel didn't mean I agreed with their policies. From that
 point on, Eric referred to me as a Mossad agent, but our relations 
remained warm. When he accepted my friend request on Nov. 30, he 
understood I was a potential Israeli agent (in his view) but apparently 
felt okay about it.<br>
<br>
Getting to know Eric, I started becoming really worried about him. He 
had an obvious mental disorder, and I felt he faced almost certain death
 in Syria. If I were a rebel leader, I wouldn't want him fighting on my 
side because his judgment was so poor. Because he was an American, he 
was more likely to become a political pawn. Even if Assad was bad, Eric 
was not going to help anyone's cause by going to Syria. He was just 
going to get himself killed—or worse: captured by one side or the other.<br>
<br>
One evening, I decided to give him a friendly talk, trying to dissuade 
him from going to Syria. I gave it my best. I repeated back to him his 
own observation that his brain had been "totally fucked up" by his 
injury. I said something to the effect of: "You have no judgment, dude! 
Your brain injury has taken it away from you. It took you three hours in
 Istanbul finding an address anyone else could find in twenty minutes. 
If you get out there in a war zone, you won't be able to tell friend 
from foe. Not everyone fighting Assad is good. Some of those guys could 
be just as dangerous as Assad's forces, but because of your brain 
injury, you won't be able to tell the difference. If you go to Syria, 
you are going to die, dude. I don't know how to put this more bluntly: <i>You are going to die!</i>"<br>
<br>
Eric listened respectfully and said he would think about what I said, 
but I knew I didn't have any effect on him. His actions weren't under 
rational control, so nothing I said would stop him.<br>
<br>
I felt comfortable after that. At least I tried.<br>
<br>
I friended him on Facebook and followed his posts. A few weeks after I 
left Turkey, he posted photos and videos of himself in&nbsp;Jihadist 
garb, seeming to wage war against Assad's forces. In my mind, it was all
 for show. I think the social media postings making him <i>seem </i>like
 a&nbsp;Jihadist fighter were more important to him than anything he 
actually did in Syria. According to the Wikipedia page, he was only in 
Syria for a little more than a month (Jan 7 to Feb 10, 2013), just 
enough time to collect some war stories and lots of good material for 
Facebook.<br>
<br>
To me, his most remarkable accomplishment in Syria was that he came out alive!<br>
<br>
Via Istanbul, he eventually made his way back to the USA, where he was 
arrested. The only reason he was arrested (I read in another article) 
was that he went to the U.S. Government and explicitly told them he had 
been in Syria fighting Assad. The government didn't come to him; he want
 to them! This is consistent with the Eric I knew, seeing things in 
black and white and possessing no critical judgment whatsoever. As far 
as I knew, he was incapable of lying or hiding his intent—which isn't 
necessarily a good thing. He was a loyal American, so why shouldn't he 
tell his government what he had been up to? His prosecution was public, 
and there were a lot of news articles about it. None of the articles 
seemed to pick up on his brain injury.<br>
<br>
When I learned of Eric's arrest, I was relieved! At least that meant he 
was safe. Up to that point, his intention was to return to Syria to 
continue the fight (or so he claimed). At least being arrested meant he 
would stay alive a little longer.<br>
<br>
But Eric couldn't escape his brain injury. When I learned he had died a 
few months ago, I wasn't surprised. One way or another, he was a time 
bomb waiting to go off. Dying of a drug overdose was plausible to me, 
because he didn't have the judgment to, say, decide how much drugs were 
too much. There were worse ways to die, like being beheaded on an ISIS 
video. Eric at least died painlessly without causing as much distress to
 others as he might have.<br>
<br>
I don't regret meeting Eric. It was a window into a piece of history. 
The important thing to me is that I made a reasonable effort to dissuade
 him. I probably wasn't the only one. I'm sure his family was deeply 
distressed by the direction his life went, but I doubt there was 
anything they could have done either. It all came down to that brain 
injury in 2003. From that point on, his critical judgment was gone and 
his fate was sealed.<br>

<br>
By <a href="http://glenn-campbell.com/">Glenn Campbell</a> (updated Sept. 22, 2014)<br>
<br>
I fly to Europe from the USA about twice a year, always on an extremely 
tight budget. Compared to airfares within the USA, transatlantic fares 
are atrocious, but here are some ways to find the lowest fares. I never 
spend more than $800 for a roundtrip, even with some fancy stopovers, 
and I have occasionally found fares as low as $600. The article contains
 my tips for getting across the pond for the lowest airfare possible, 
honed over about 5 years of active travel.<br>
<br>
<div>
Airfare is the most significant trip component for a budget US visitor 
to Europe. You can speculate about where you may want to&nbsp;go and 
stay, but you have to nail down your airfare before anything else. Once 
you have a cheap airfare across the pond, everything else can be worked 
out. Cheap airfares within Europe often mean your best bet is to land in
 an obscure city then take a train or cheap flight to your intended 
destination. If you are into hosteling, then your ground accommodations 
can be quite affordable, but you have to get across the pond first.<br>
<br>
Taxes and fees make up a huge portion of transatlantic airfares, far 
more than flying either within USA or within Europe. They often dwarf 
the actual fare (as shown above: my 2013 NYC-Warsaw trip with a stopover
 in London: Airfare $128. Taxes/fees $670.). The taxes and fees are the 
main reason low airfares are so fare. <b>A round-trip airfare of about $700 is the best you can expect.</b> In the summer (June-August) fares go sky-high. In that case, anything
 under $1000 r/t would be golden. The rest of the year, even around 
Christmas, you are aiming for a fare of $700-800. <br>
<br>
Whatever time of year you travel, don't get discouraged when the first 
fares you see are high. There is always a way if you are willing to be 
creative and land in an unexpected place. Once you hop the pond, 
airfares within Europe are comparable to those within the USA, and there
 are plenty of bargains to be had.<br>
<br>
To find the lowest fares, just plug a lot of different city pairs into <a href="http://expedia.com/">Expedia </a>or
 another travel site. Start with the cities you most want to visit then 
experiment with others. Think of creative ways to get where you want to 
go. The main obstacle is the Atlantic Ocean, once you're over that, 
there are a lot of options for getting around within Europe. It costs 
you nothing to plug city pairs into Expedia, so do it recklessly!<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Here are some specific tips on working with Expedia and other travel resources.... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li><b>On the US side, always start with NYC.</b> Transatlantic fares 
out of New York are usually far cheaper than from anywhere else on the 
continent, even if you have to pay for a separate&nbsp;connecting flight
 to get there. (Always search for&nbsp;the code "NYC", not JFK, so you 
include flights out of EWR.) After you find a low NYC airfare, you can 
experiment with other USA cities heading to that same European 
destination. </li>
<li>&nbsp;CHI, WAS, QLA, QSF, ATL, MCO, MIA, YYZ and BOS are often worth
 checking too,&nbsp;but most of my transatlantic journeys start in New 
York. </li>
<li>Fares to <b>Eastern Europe cities</b> are usually lower than "old" 
European cities like Paris, London, Rome, Amsterdam, even when changing 
planes in those expensive cities. Try <b>Warsaw, Istanbul, Riga</b>, etc. Getting to <b>Moscow</b> always seems to be cheap (fares around $700 r/t) but the visa process is hell if you plan to leave the airport. (Here are my<a href="http://travel.baddalailama.com/2012/09/moscow.html"> Russians visa tips</a>, even though my effort failed.)</li>
<li>Check Expedia frequently for rogue fares. A "rogue fare" is my term 
for a low airfare the appears only for a short time in an unexpected 
place. They could pop up anywhere, and you find out about them only by 
checking airfares frequently. An exceptional fare would be around 
$600-700. If you see a great fare, book it immediately. On Expedia, you 
have 24 hours to ask for a full refund—a feature I use liberally.</li>
<li>In 2014, <b>Copenhagen </b>was a surprising low-fare city. Try it! I
 flew from JFK to CPH for $748 r/t, and such fares were consistently 
available in late 2014, even booking at the last minute. Copenhagen 
itself is horrendously expensive (twice the prices as the USA, with 
hostels starting at $40), but it is easy to get directly from the 
airport to Germany by train. For example, you can get off your flight at
 CPH in the morning, board a train directly from the airport terminal 
and be in Hamburg or Berlin by the end of the day. In Germany, you'll 
find prices about the same as the USA. Train tickets can be booked 
online at Bahn.de. </li>
<li>My experience in Copenhagen suggests you should never discount 
Scandinavia for low fares. The fact that the cities are expensive 
doesn't necessarily mean airfares are.</li>
<li>In theory, you could book a trip to a cheap Eastern Europe city, 
then get off the plane in, say, London. Unfortunately, your luggage has 
to go all the way to your destination. I also worry that my remaining 
legs may be cancelled if I fail to get on a connecting flight. (Probably
 not a real risk, but I can't be positive.) This system works better on 
the US side, where you can, say, abort your journey in New York when you
 change planes there. In USA, your luggage is always returned to you at 
the first city you land in, so you can clear customs, and you have to 
recheck your luggage for connecting flights. Such is not true when you 
land in, say, AMS. In Europe, you won't see your luggage until your 
final destination, so it is best to stick with your booked 
itinerary.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Use cut-rate&nbsp;carriers to get around within Europe for a song. (See this great <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Discount_airlines_in_Europe">overview of European Discount Airlines</a> on Wikitravel.&nbsp;I have have good experiences with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.easyjet.com/en">EasyJet</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flypgs.com/en/default.aspx">Pegasus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://airbaltic.com/">Air Baltic</a>.)&nbsp;Many
 of these airlines are not listed on Expedia and other travel sites. You
 have to go directly to their websites. Play with dates and book ahead 
for the best fares. (Be aware that these airlines hit you with extra 
charges whenever they can, including checked bags and even checking in 
at the airport instead of online. Read the fine print.)</li>
<li>Check the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bahn.com/i/view/GBR/en/index.shtml">Deutsche Bahn</a>
 website for train fares within Europe. Train is often a good 
alternative to flying within Europe. Low fares require only a minimal 
advance purchase. The Bahn site allowed you to immediately book trains 
that begin or end in Germany. For other trains, the site is useful 
mainly for schedules.</li>
<li>Once you find a low cost round-trip transatlantic airfare to a city 
you are interested in, try experimenting with stopover options in 
gateway cities like Paris and London. You can often get a 24 hour 
stopover at little or no additional charge. (If you stay longer, the 
price will probably go up.)</li>
<li>Once you have identified a low airfare out of NYC, try using 
multicity options to return to a different USA city. For example 
roundtrips out of Cleveland may be expensive, but a multicity trip that 
starts in New York City and ends in Cleveland may not be. (All you have 
to add is the separate one way leg from Cleveland to NYC. Be sure to 
allow a lot of time to connect, since the airline won't protect you if 
the separate first leg is late.)</li>
<li>Also experiment with multicity legs within Europe, and see what you 
get. Sometimes visiting a Eastern European city&nbsp;with a long 
"stopover" in London or Paris can be cheaper than a round trip to London
 or Paris, even if your main destination is London or Paris.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Westway-Hotel-and-Hostel-La-Guardia-New-York/New-York/63438">Westway Hotel</a>
 is my fallback hostel&nbsp;lodging when connecting in NYC via LGA. 
Located about a 10-minute bus ride from LGA and under and hour by subway
 from JFK. Not romantic but always $40 a night. If only JFK is involve, 
not LGA, then try the <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Q4-Hotel/New-York/58186">Q4 Hotel</a> or the <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/The-New-York-Loft-Hostel/New-York/27128">NY Loft Hostel</a>, which are convenient by subway to the airport.</li>
<li>Note: The cost of getting from the airport to the city can be 
non-trivial in Western Europe. You need to factor it into your budget. 
Check the airport's official website for guidance. If train seems to 
expensive, look into an airport bus.</li>
<li>Be conscious of the frequent flyer miles you are accruing, since 
they can be huge. One round trip to Europe can sometimes get you half 
the miles you need for free round-trip within the USA, or get you much 
closer to elite status. Faced with comparable airfares from different 
airlines, frequent flyer benefits usually guide my choice. I'm even 
willing to pay a $100 premium for the right FF miles.</li>
<li>Consider flying <a href="http://www.icelandair.us/">Icelandair</a>. 
Their fares are competitive with other airlines, but they allow you a 
free stopover in Iceland. (Icelandair has useless frequent-flier 
benefits, however. No reciprocal airlines.) See my <a href="http://travel.baddalailama.com/2012/09/notes-on-iceland.html">Iceland Travel Advice</a>.</li>
<li><b>Aeroflot</b> is often the cheapest airline to Eastern 
Europe.&nbsp;You don't need a visa to connect because you will not be 
leaving the transit area (like Edward Snowden), but apparently there is a
 passport check there, which makes me uncomfortable. Before the Ukraine 
problems in 2014, I was willing to fly Aeroflot, but until Ukraine is 
settled, I regard it is risky. Not any physical danger, but your flight 
could be cancelled if tensions escalate.</li>
<li>Fun fact: In the summer, it is about the same price to fly from JFK to India as it is to fly from JFK to London. </li>
<li>If you want to fly between cities within Europe, plug-in a lot of 
different dates and city pairs Into Expedia. Fares can vary widely from 
day to day&nbsp;and city to city. On Expedia, I have encountered a lot 
of low "rogue fares" popping up in unexpected places. Remember that you 
can use the train to connect from a low-fare city to the one you 
actually want to go to. Cut-rate carriers often fly out of obscure 
airports you never heard of.</li>
<li>Eastern Europe and Western Europe are different economies. Eastern 
Europe prices can be half of those of Western Europe for things like 
food, lodging and ground transportation. Eastern Europe however is just 
as safe, modern and easy to get around&nbsp;for an English speaker as 
Western Europe.</li>
<li>Train travel can be expensive within Western Europe, almost as much 
is flying, but it is usually cheap in Eastern Europe. Also look into 
luxury buses between Eastern European cities. In Western Europe, buying 
your tickets a few days in advance can greatly reduce the cost.</li>
<li>In my younger years, I used a Eurail Pass to loaf around Europe. Now
 I consider it not a particularly good deal. You can do a lot better 
with point-to-point fares on a variety of modes (plane, train, bus).</li>
<li>For a visitor from USA, only Russia and Belarus require 
pre-arranged&nbsp;visas. (And the Russian one is extremely difficult. 
See my <a href="http://travel.baddalailama.com/2012/09/moscow.html">Russia visa article</a>.) Nonetheless, be sure to look into the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis_pa_tw_1168.html">US state department's advice on travel</a> and visas for every country you are visiting.</li>
<li>Learn how to Hostel! It means you can find cheap accommodations 
wherever you go and at any season. Hosteling also gives you contact with
 a lot of other travelers for advice on where to go and how to get 
around.&nbsp;See <a href="http://hostelworld.com/">hostelworld.com</a>. Personally, I would stay in hostels even if I could afford the Hilton.</li>
<li>There is usually no compelling reason to buy an airfare more than a 
month or two&nbsp;before traveling, except perhaps in the summer. You 
don't usually get a cheaper fare, but you are restricting your ability 
to change or to come up with something even better. I usually buy my own
 airfares about a month in advance and have still gotten some 
ridiculously cheap ones. Nonetheless, once you know you are travelling, 
kept checking airfares on your preferred travel sites. If you are 
traveling in summer and see a fare for under $1000, you might want to 
grab it.</li>
<li>Travel sites like Expedia give you a 24 hour grace period after you 
purchase your ticket to obtain a full refund. (You cancel the flight 
right on the website.) This means when you see a low fare, you can grab 
it right away. Then you have 24 hours to piece together other elements 
of your trip and decide whether you really want it.</li>
<li><i>All</i> forms of transportation—ground and air—can bog down in 
Western Europe in July and August. Advanced planning of intercity legs 
is important then. The rest of the year you can be much more relaxed and
 just work things out when you get there. (June is a more relaxed month 
and a good time to travel. Only the airfare is a barrier.)</li>
<li>Don't over-plan the ground portion of your visit. It's hard to know 
what you are going to want to do until you get there. Just go with the 
flow. I don't bother reading travel books or doing much research before I
 arrive. (I'd rather just go there than waste time <i>reading</i> about going there.) With the Internet at your hostel, you can bring a laptop and&nbsp;work on it all out once you get there.</li>
<li>When should you buy, and when should you wait? That's probably the 
most difficult issue of all. If you find a low-fare online it is 
tempting to buy it right away. You lock in the low fare, but you also 
lock out any better option that you can't yet foresee. Deciding when to 
buy is more of an art than a science. It rests on your experience with 
airfares but also in your knowledge of yourself. Many people just can't 
handle ambiguity in their plans. They are under pressure to buy now, but
 they may regret it when they see what they've overlooked. Others delay 
and put off the purchase too long, and then the low airfares are gone. 
You have to find a balance between the two.</li>
<li>I found some surprisingly low transatlantic fares for selected dates on <a href="http://www.norwegian.com/">Norwegian Airlines</a>
 (Oslo, etc). They have a fare calculator to show you the dates of the 
lowest fares. I constructed a hypothetical fare in November 2013 of $400
 roundtrip from NYC, including tax. (Luggage, seat selection and meal 
for $69 more.) Also Fort Lauderdale to Oslo for similar pricing. This 
airline is not listed on major travel websites (and probably doesn't 
give useful FF miles).</li>
<li>It's fine to use a website like Expedia to search for airfares, but 
when it comes to actually buying the airfare you have found, consider 
using the airline's own website. The reason: If you have to make 
changes, you can deal directly with the airline. If you book through a 
"travel agent" (which includes Expedia and other websites) then the 
airline may require you to do it through them.</li>

<div>
Note: The blacked out city in the image above is Warsaw. (I didn't want 
to reveal that when I first created this entry.) Yes, that's a round 
trip transatlantic airfare of $123 (plus taxes and fees), including a 
24-hour stopover in London.</div>

<b>Porterville, California, April 27, 2013.</b> The photo above that I 
took in a city park earned me a visit and lengthy interview from the 
local police department. In the course of the encounter, the officer 
took a photo of me and even asked me for my shoe size! Here is the full 
story:<br>
<br>
I was on a week-long "working vacation" in California, doing some 
sightseeing but also working on a book. I had just visited Sequoia 
National Forest and I was now in this small Central Valley city just 
below the mountains. I was sitting in my rental car in a city park 
(Murry Park) working on my computer when this couple appeared directly 
in front of me. I couldn't resist the free photo op! I picked up my 
camera from the car seat beside me and took six frames while still 
sitting in the drivers seat of the car. (The best photo is above.) I was
 using a telephoto lens (on my Canon 60D), so the couple was actually 
quite far away. The "bride" said, "Hey, he's taking pictures!" at which 
point I stopped shooting, put down the camera, smiled and waved. I 
didn't want to make them uncomfortable. My whole photo shoot lasted 20 
seconds at most. The group got back into the car next to mine. Although 
my windows were open and they were just a few feet away, they didn't say
 anything to me.<br>
<br>
(I assumed at the time that it was a wedding couple, but a friend points
 out that these are probably prom outfits. Not elaborate enough for a 
wedding, and the "groom" is wearing sneakers.)<br>
<br>
About an hour after they left, an officer of the Porterville Police 
Department arrived in a cruiser. He said that someone has reported me 
for taking photos. (It could only have been the prom party, and I assume
 it was the girl, since she was the only one who seemed to notice me.) 
The officer was very friendly and agreed that I was doing nothing 
illegal, but we had a very long interview anyway (with him standing 
outside my vehicle and me inside with a computer on my lap). I was asked
 about who I was, where I had been, where I was going. I was happy to 
answer, because I had nothing to hide. The officer took my licence back 
to his cruiser where he said he was filling out a written report. Then 
he came back to the car and asked if he could take my photo (with a 
small camera he brought from his cruiser). I laughed at that! I said 
that since I was taking photos of the wedding party without their 
permission, I couldn't object to him taking a photo of me! He asked me 
to step out of the car for the photo, which I did. I gave him a big 
smile as he took a photo of me standing in front of my rental car.<br>
<br>
After that, he asked me more information for his report. He asked for my
 height, and I pointed out that it was on my driver's licence which he 
held in his hand. He also asked for my social security number (which was
 not on my license) and my phone number. He then asked for my shoe size.
 I drew the line at this. I laughed and told him I was asserting my 
"Miranda rights" and I refused to give him my shoe size. He guessed that
 my shoe size was 10, but I refused to confirm or deny this information.
 The officer completed his report; we chatted a bit, and he left.<br>
<br>
My actual photography of the couple lasted no more than 20 seconds. Six 
quick photos. The interview with the officer lasted about 20 minutes. 
The officer never asked to see the photos I had taken, and I did not 
offer to show them to him. Although the encounter was cordial, the 
incident struck me as petty and a senseless waste of police resources. 
Can you imagine the LAPD responding to a complaint like this and 
spending so much time on it? (I'm sure the first question of LAPD 
dispatchers would be, "What law has allegedly been violated here?") What
 was the bigger personal intrusion: my photography or the police 
interview?<br>
<br>
After the officer left, I decided it was time to depart the park. I 
moved to the parking lot of the local Walmart, where I knew I wouldn't 
be hassled, and I continued working on my computer for a few hours. (I 
was publishing a new ebook, <a href="http://kilroycafe.com/">"Kilroy Cafe"</a>.) After nightfall, I decided to leave Porterville forever.<br>
<br>
But leaving Porterville wasn't so easy. Rather like a Stephen King novel
 where a character tries to get out of a small rural town but can't. The
 story continues...<br>
<br>
During this week-long visit to California, I was sleeping in my rental 
car at night. I usually have no problem with this. The weather was nice,
 and I usually choose my overnight parking locations well, so people 
don't notice me. Sometimes I sleep in Walmart parking lots, but it was 
too warm for that. I needed a remote place to park where I could open 
the car windows.<br>
<br>
After dark, I headed out of Porterville toward the west, until I thought
 I was beyond the city limits. I didn't want another encounter with the 
Porterville police! I found what I thought was an empty desert area near
 an aquaduct. It was dark, but I saw no habitation around, so I pulled 
into the desert, well away from the road.<br>
<br>
I went to sleep in the back seat, only be wakened about an hour later 
by... another police officer! He was in a different uniform and a 
different style of car, so I assume he was a county officer. He said 
that a neighbor had reported me. I was surprised, because I looked 
around me and could see no neighbors, just dark desert. The officer 
agreed that I wasn't doing anything wrong, but he took my license back 
to his cruiser.<br>
<br>
When he returned to my car, he commented on my camera on the passenger 
seat, which suggested to me that he now knew about the earlier 
photography incident.<br>
<br>
"You weren't out here taking pictures of people were you?" he asked.<br>
<br>
I assured him that I was here only to sleep. (I did not bother to point 
out to him that, in this location, there was no one to take pictures 
of!)<br>
<br>
The officer did not tell me that sleeping in a car was illegal, and he 
did not ask me to move, but I offered to move anyway. He agreed that 
this was probably a good idea because the current situation we "just a 
little creepy." He suggested the I go back to town and sleep in the 
Walmart parking lot.<br>
<br>
At this point, there was NO WAY I was returning to Porterville! I could 
imagine this thing growing bigger and bigger, with vague suspicions 
about this outsider continuing to grow until they found something to 
charge me with.<br>
<br>
After the county officer left, I got back on the road and continued 
west. Although it was late, I was now determined to get out of this 
county as quickly as possible! I drove for a hour until I was sure I was
 beyond Tulare County. I found a safe parking place near the main 
freeway, and I got at least a few hours sleep without further 
interruption.<br>
<br>
Nice town, Porterville. I can tell people are concerned about safety. 
When you urge people, "If you see something, say something," they 
apparently take it seriously. And without much crime, police apparently 
have a LOT of time to investigate suspicious activities. Still, for a 
guy like me, engaged in "unusual" activities or lifestyle, this small 
town Utopia can get tired really fast.<br>
<br>
I'm still in the desert as I write this (near Palmdale on April 30), but
 the Big City is looking really attractive right now! There, they have 
something called "crime", which is good in a way. At least it keeps the 
police occupied and off the backs of people whose only crime is being 
"unusual".<br>
<br>
If you happen to know the couple in the photo, perhaps you can forward 
the photo to them. (Shot April 27, 2013 around 4pm in Murry Park in 
Porterville, California, and photographed in Murry Park.) Here is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200654775144139&amp;l=6b0516d100">the&nbsp;hi-res photo on Facebook</a>.</div>

By <a href="http://glenn-campbell.com/">Glenn Campbell</a><br>
Mar. 13, 2014<br>
<br>
To visit Russia, almost everyone needs a visa, and getting one is a 
convoluted process virtually unchanged since the days of the Soviet 
Union. My own attempt to obtain a tourist visa FAILED because I ran out 
of time, energy and money. But I did gain some valuable experience, 
which I want to share with any American who cares to try. The process is
 not impossible, just convoluted. To give the Russians the benefit of 
the doubt, let's call it "whimsical".<br>
<br>
In the original blog entry here (Sept. 2012), I had some hypothetical 
advice on obtaining a Russian tourist visa, based only on what I found 
on the internet. Now that I have actually gone through the process, I 
deleted most of the post and replaced it with the things I now know from
 my own direct experience.<br>
<br>
I was planning a visit to Moscow on a 18-day European trip, but the 
Russian Consulate called me in for a personal interview in New York only
 about 3 weeks before I was to leave home. This interrogation—er, 
interview—was necessary before the visa was granted. Since I was in 
another part of the USA at the time, it would have been prohibitively 
expensive to fly to New York for this interview, so I decided to throw 
in the towel and abort the Russian leg of my vacation. (Technically, I 
withdrew my visa application. It wasn't rejected.)<br>
<br>
(Being called in for an interview may or may not have had anything to do
 with the Ukrainian crisis. My airline ticket was bought long before the
 Russian invasion of Crimea, but my visa didn't reach the consulate 
until a week after it. There's no way of knowing their reasons for 
wanting to interview me personally, since I didn't go.)<br>
<br>
Expense aside, at the point where the government of Vladimir Putin calls
 you in for a personal interview, you have to wonder if the process is 
worth the vulnerability and loss of privacy. They wanted more 
documentation: bank statements, proof of income, evidence of real estate
 holdings and certificate of health insurance. This was in line with 
what the United States might require for a Russian wanting a visa to the
 USA—to assure they will go home—but for me it had become too burdensome
 in time, money and anxiety. Visiting Russia just wasn't important 
enough to me to jump through all the hoops.<br>
<br>
Although my own effort failed, I picked up a few bits of advice that 
might be helpful to another American who might want to apply for a 
tourist visa. The process is not impossible, just a journey in itself. 
Here is my advice as of March 2014...<br>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Start the visa application process EARLY, as it could take a long 
time to work out the defects in your application. And the process is so 
obtuse and poorly documented that there probably WILL be defects.</li>
<li>USA residents are supposed submit their applications through an intermediate agency, <a href="http://www.ils-usa.com/main.php">Invisa Logisitic Services</a>,
 not directly to the Russian consulate. These people are taking a cut 
(and a BIG cut if you want the visa mailed back to you), but the agent I
 dealt with at ILS was very nice. Although the process is still clunky, 
ILS is probably going to be a lot more user-friendly than the consulate 
could ever be.</li>
<li>I strongly urge you to visit an ILS office in person to deliver your
 visa application, because they can tell you right away whether anything
 is wrong, and they might be able to correct the problem immediately. 
Correcting problems by mail can be awkward. Only when everything is 
perfect will the ILS submit the application to the consulate. (You need 
an appointment at ILS, but it's free.)</li>
<li>You may be called into the Russian consulate for an interview at a 
time of their choosing (as I was), so you have to be prepared for it. 
Only the Russians know who gets called in and why. This is going to be 
the consulate where you made the application, so if you don't live in 
one of the major cities where a consulate is located, just getting to 
the interview could be awkward and expensive (the thing that killed the 
process for me).</li>
<li>USA residents are supposed to apply for a 3-year multiple entry 
visa, but the forms seem to be only interested in a single trip. 
Apparently you are supposed to fill out the forms for your FIRST planned
 visit, although it doesn't really state this anywhere.</li>
<li>The application requires copies of your plane tickets to and from 
Russia, so you need to book them in advance (not knowing if you are 
actually going to get the visa). As a hedge, I think you should book 
your transatlantic flights to a traditional European city that doesn't 
require visas (like Warsaw), then book cut-rate local flights from there
 into Russia. That way if you can't get into Russia, you only lose the 
cheap flights and can still have a nice European vacation. (<a href="http://www.airbaltic.com/en/index">Air Baltic</a>
 is a great airline for getting into Russia cheaply.) DO NOT ASSUME ANY 
LENIENCY FROM THE AIRLINE IF YOU FAIL TO GET A VISA. (In my case, the 
same change/cancellation fees applied.) Once you have the 3-year visa 
and have made your first visit, it is safer to fly directly to Russia.</li>
<li>The visa application itself is generated by clunky software on a 
Russian government website, which produces a PDF that you print out. Be 
sure to bring your application number and password with you to ILS, 
because if something is wrong with the application, they can reprint it 
for you while you wait. (It is awkward to get back into the application 
after you have printed it the first time, but I finally figured it out. 
Hint: go back to the topmost level.)</li>
<li>The 3-year visa requires TWO identical visa applications. I never 
saw that instruction online anywhere. The ILS agent had to tell me. 
(Each application needs a passport photo attached.)</li>
<li>For the three-year visa, the dates on the application are the date 
of your first entry into Russia and the same day three years later (or 
maybe the day before, I'm not sure. I would use the day before.). At 
least, that's what the ILS agent put on my revised application.</li>
<li>The application requires you to list the cities you expect to visit 
in Russia. How are you supposed to do this for a 3-year multiple entry 
visa? I just listed the city I planned to visit on my first trip: 
Moscow. (Will you get in trouble for visiting other cities you didn't 
list on your original application? In the Soviet era, you probably 
would. These days, who knows?)</li>
<li>You need an "invitation" to come to Russia. This is relatively easy to obtain if you plan to stay in a <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/search?search_keywords=Moscow%2C+Russia&amp;country=Russia&amp;city=Moscow">hostel in Moscow</a>, like <a href="http://godzillashostel.com/moscow/">Godzilla's</a>.
 For $35, they will provide an invitation sent by email. (Although even 
that process can be clunky. I had to email them a couple of times to get
 a readable JPG version.)</li>
<li>There can be absolutely no pen marks on the application form apart 
from your signature and date. No scratches or white-outs. Just another 
way the bureaucracy tries to trip you up.</li>
<li>The application seems to require health insurance for your stay. I used <a href="https://geobluetravelinsurance.com/">GeoBlue</a>
 to get insurance for my first visit then printed out the documentation 
they provided. I think that was sufficient, but since I didn't get the 
visa, I can't be sure.</li>
<li>Once you have the visa and have taken your first visit to Russia, it
 "seems" that you can come and go from Russia as you please... but don't
 take my word for it. The wonderful thing about Russia is YOU NEVER KNOW
 WHAT THE RULES REALLY MEAN.</li>
<li>Seriously, do you really need to go to Russia? There are so many 
great places Americans can visit without visas (nearly all of Europe 
apart from Belarus and Russia). The Russian Government tries so hard to 
turn away tourists that you really have to be dedicated to make it 
happen.</li>
<li>Needless to say, if you've got plenty of money, there are bound to 
be agencies and tour companies willing to relieve you of it to "help" 
you with the visa process. I can't give you any advice on them. At that 
point, my budget it burst and I'd rather hang out in "old" Europe for 
much less.</li>
</ol>
<div>
The tips above only scratch the surface. The visa application process is
 still totally Cold War, and I didn't have the stamina to pull it off. 
Maybe you will do better.</div>

<br>
Sometimes even a homeless travelling dude has to lay back and chill for a
 while, so where does he do it without a home? It has to be someplace 
with mild weather where he can get by cheaply. It also has to be 
someplace well-connected with transportation options, especially if he 
doesn't know where he is going next. So where is the best place in North
 America to conduct such a-chill'n?<br>
<br>
Transportation-wise, you might think that someplace in the center of the
 country would be best, like St. Louis or Kansas City, where you are 
equidistant from the coasts and where the cost of living is low. Turns 
out, however, that airfares to and from these places aren't cheap. Due 
to competitive pressures, it is usually cheaper to fly from, say, New 
York to L.A. than from St. Louis to L.A. Furthermore, although the cost 
of living may be low in the Heartland for people who live there, there 
aren't many options for the traveler, like hostels or cheap intercity 
buses.<br>
<br>
You might think that New York City would be a good transportation hub, 
and it is, but transportation is just about all that New York offers. 
It's a jungle, painful to get in and out of and not the sort of place 
you can comfortably chill homelessly. Even the New York suburbs are 
dense and hard to navigate.<br>
<br>
So where is the best hang-out for the homeless traveler? Suburban 
Washington, D.C.! I'm there right now, typing in the back seat of my 
cheap rental car in Alexandria, Virginia. Due to the vagaries of my 
business (gun for hire), I don't know exactly where I will be going 
next, and given that fact, this is the best place in the world to be.<br>
<br>
I'm not interested in downtown Washington. I've already seen every 
tourist attraction. The suburbs are the "in" place for me, usually 
Virginia not far from Dulles or National airport. I rent a big full-size
 car and <a href="http://travel.baddalailama.com/2009/04/how-to-sleep-in-car.html">sleep in it</a>.
 National airport is often a surprisingly cheap place to rent a car. 
This one, a spacious Impala, set me back $136/week, which is pretty 
cheap housing.<br>
<br>
In D.C., I am blessed with the nation's best selection of transportation
 options. There are three airports: DCA, IAD and BWI, all accessible by 
public transit. Wherever I need to fly to, chances are one of those 
airports will offer a low fare.<br>
<br>
D.C. is also a hub for <a href="http://us.megabus.com/">Megabus</a>, the
 new bus line the offering fares between major cities far less than 
Greyhound or Amtrak. I can get to New York or Philadelphia for $25 any 
day, which puts even more airports within my reach (PHL, EWR, JFK, LGA, 
RIC). Long haul routes are only about $45 to Boston, Toronto, Knoxville,
 Pittsburgh and Charlotte, and with connecting routes I can get as far 
as Florida, Minnesota or Texas. (See <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/MegabusNorthAmericaMap.svg">their system map</a>.)
 Megabus can be cramped if every seat is booked, but one huge advantage 
is power sockets at every seat (more valuable to me than the wifi). Now,
 I can compute continuously from the moment I sit down.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://http//Amtrak.com">Amtrak </a>is an option if you can 
plan ahead, but their last-minute fares are way too high. If I wanted to
 go to New York today, I'd be paying $153 on Amtrak but still only 
$25-33 on Megabus. Megabus is really what made D.C. a hub for me. If I 
were a foreign backpacker touring the U.S., I would fly into whatever 
Eastern city had the best airfares than using Megabus to tour the East 
Coast. Cheaper than any sort of bus or rail pass.<br>
<br>
The ambiance is nice in the D.C. suburbs. Here I have access to one of the two health club chains I belong to (<a href="http://www.anytimefitness.com/">Anytime Fitness</a>),
 so showers and exercise are near at hand. Plenty of food options and 
other services. I can park almost anywhere to work or sleep; these 
suburbs are spacious enough that no one cares. I certainly have no 
concern for my safety in the Virginia suburbs. Demographics protect me 
from the rif-raff of the inner city.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are plenty of Walmarts in Virginia for all my supply 
needs (clothing, camping supplies, etc.). These would be hard to come by
 in the dense suburbs of New York or Boston.<br>
<br>
Only the summer sucks, when the humidity can be oppressive and sleeping 
in the car is a challenge. Cold is almost never a problem when sleeping 
in a car: You just close the windows and add more clothing and Walmart 
sleeping bags. Heat is the problem. To sleep in the car in the summer in
 Virginia, I would have to open all the windows for ventilation, and 
that means I have to be in a remote location with few mosquitoes. Good 
luck finding that! I would probably drive far out of D.C. in that case, 
perhaps to the shore where I can find some sea breeze.<br>
<br>
D.C. also has hostels if I need them. (See <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/search?search_keywords=Washington+DC%2C+USA&amp;country=USA&amp;city=Washington-DC">the selection on Hostelworld</a>.)
 If a rental car is prohibitively expensive or I need to catch an early 
morning bus, I may use a hostel for the night, generally for $25 to $40.
 Several are within walking distance of Union Station.<br>
<br>
There is sightseeing here if I care to do it. While I have been to all the major D.C. attractions (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1684741750733.2091644.1003315385&amp;l=ec98255624">my photos</a>)
 there are always more obscure museums to explore. It seems that every 
organization wants to put some sort of museum or monument in Washington,
 and it would take years to visit them all.<br>
<br>
Did I mention that it's our nation's capital? I may be jaded from 
overexposure, but Washington is a city that everyone should visit. Most 
of the government attractions are free. "Washington" looms so large in 
the news, that I think every human should have some direct experience 
with it.<br>
<br>
But best to sleep in a rental car in the suburbs if you want an easy visit.</div>

<br>
I am just coming to the end of a three-day visit to Iceland. (I am 
writing from my hostel in Reykjavik.) I feel very comfortable here and 
hope to come back someday. Here are my notes—things you might not figure
 out with Google alone. <b>Also see my Facebook photos: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4251659762079.2168833.1003315385&amp;type=3&amp;l=4c5d80c31a">Iceland </a>and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4264961054603.2169175.1003315385&amp;type=1&amp;l=27e4c6669c">Reykjavik</a>&nbsp;and here is a <a href="http://j.mp/NT8Onr">Google Map of my drive</a>.&nbsp;</b><br>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Iceland is very green. (Don't believe the "ice" part. It's Greenland
 that's the icy one.) It seems about equivalent in terrain and climate 
to the north of Scotland. Supposedly, winter temperatures are as mild as
 New York or Toronto, but it's probably much more gray and rainy. Bring 
an umbrella!</li>
<br>
<li>Iceland is basically one giant volcano. 100% of the landscape is volcanic, primarily endless lava fields covered with moss.</li>
<br>
<li>There is hardly a tree anywhere! I found this especially surprising,
 because even Siberia has trees. Apparently Iceland was once forested 
but got pillaged of trees by the Vikings. Most of the landscape is 
mosses, grasses and low shrubs. At least there's nothing to obscure your
 view!</li>
<br>
<li>I was surprises by the lack of obvious history. There are museums 
but hardly any old buildings. Almost all the buildings in Iceland look 
new, as though the island was settled only in the past 50 years. It is 
hard to find any old buildings apart from a few stone foundations. The 
only "history" is what you read on information signs. Although the 
Vikings were here for centuries, they apparently built with wood and 
sod, which has rotted away. What's left looks like generic modern 
Scandinavia.</li>
<br>
<li>Iceland is expensive, but once you take care of food and lodging, 
there's not much opportunity to spend money. This is a good place to use
 hostels and camp to avoid outrageous lodging charges.</li>
<br>
<li>The only hostels are in Reykjavik. I was very happy with the Kex 
Hostel. For a short stay or for the first couple of days of a longer 
one, this is a pretty good base of operations, since the main tourist 
sites can be done in day trips from there.</li>
<br>
<li>You really need a rental car to do Iceland justice. You can take 
tours to see the sights, but it is very confining and may not be much 
cheaper than having your own car and stopping where you wish.</li>
<br>
<li>The one thing I would bring next time is a sleeping bag to allow me 
to sleep in the car. (Even a throw-away one.) Camping supplies are 
available here but don't come cheap.</li>
<br>
<li>You have to work hard to meet an actual Icelander, and there's no 
obvious "culture" on the surface. You come here mainly for the natural 
scenery not the human environment.</li>
<br>
<li>Assuming you can find one, it seems that nearly every Icelander 
along the tourist tracks speaks English. You'll have no trouble getting 
along without knowing a word of Icelandic.</li>
<br>
<li>Icelandic towns are spotless, sanitary and bland. Hardly worth stopping in them.</li>
<br>
<li>There is virtually nothing in Iceland to hurt you. No significant 
crime and nothing poisonous. (No snakes, lizards or even frogs.) The 
only danger is your own stupidity walking on rocks or too close to a 
cliff. Iceland won't protect you from that! Even at their national 
parks, you can walk right up to the edge of a waterfall if you choose.</li>
<br>
<li>In Iceland, you'll soon suffer from Waterfall Fatigue. There are so 
many spectacular ones that after a while stopping at every one you pass 
seems like a burden.</li>
<br>
<li>"Big City" Reykjavik is only a small city in global terms (140k in 
the city and 200k in the area). Not a lot to see. You can do it all in a
 day. Add another day if you want to do the museums.</li>
<br>
<li>Two-thirds of Iceland's tiny population is concentrated around 
Reykjavik. They rest of Iceland is wild and woolly (literally). You'll 
meet only sheep and other tourists.</li>
<br>
<li>Easiest and cheapest way to visit Iceland is to stopover on an 
Icelandair flight to Europe. Stopovers of up to 7 days at no additional 
charge!</li>
<br>
<li>Gas seems to be the same fixed price everywhere in the country. In 
Sept. 2012, it was ISK 260 per liter. That's US$8.12 per gallon! A major
 part of your travel budget will be gas. (I drove a small automatic 
getting 7 km/liter. My total cost was about IKR 21000 (US$175) for 1250 
km of driving.)</li>
<br>
<li>Most gas stations are unmanned and automated. YOU MUST HAVE A PIN 
NUMBER for your credit card in order to use them! (Also, be sure to 
inform your card issuer of your overseas travel to avoid having your 
card disabled for unusual charges.)</li>
<br>
<li>My three days in Iceland were quite satisfying. I stayed at the Kex 
Hostel in Reykjavik all three nights. On the first full day, I visited 
the most popular tourist sites in the "Golden Circle". On the second 
full day, I took a long day trip to the big Vatnajokull Glacier and the 
sights along the way. On the half days on either side, I explored 
Reykjavik itself. There is a lot of Iceland I haven't yet explored, but I
 feel I got the gist and that staying longer wouldn't give me much more 
to remember. If I had 7 days, I would have driven the full Ring Road. 
(Beyond 7 days, I probably would have gone mad in Iceland!)</li>
<br>
<li><a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/KEX-Hostel/Reykjavik/48573">Kex Hostel</a>:
 Close to downtown. Good kitchen facilities with lots of food left 
behind by past guests (pasta, condiments). Free lower linen. Use your 
own sleeping bag or rent top linen/duvet for ISK 1000 per stay. Free 
parking in front of the hostel overnight, but you have to pay between 
10:00 and 16:00.</li>
<br>
<li>There are steaming volcanic springs everywhere in Iceland, but I 
never found any natural hot pools where you can soak. There are, 
however, lots of commercial and municipal hot pools where you will pay 
money to swim. (Not my cup o' tea, since I would rather keep moving.)</li>
<br>
<li>The most famous commercial hot spring is the Blue Lagoon, about 10 
km off the main road to the airport. To actually use the swimming 
facilities costs €35, but it costs nothing to visit adjoining pools or 
look through the glass at the fools willing to shell out the money to 
swim. It's not really natural, having being created as a side-effect of 
the nearby geothermal plant, but it's quite interesting and worth the 
20km diversion to see.</li>
<br>
<li>There is a nice municipal pool complex in Reykjavik (near the City 
Hostel). It's only ISK 500 (under $5), but there's nothing natural about
 it except the water itself. (It's modern swimming complex like you 
might find in Canadian cities.) It looks like other big towns have 
similar developed hot pools.</li>
<br>
<li>A full drive of the "Ring Road" around Iceland would take 4 full 
days (
I estimate,&nbsp;based on my tour of 1/4 of it) stopping at all the 
roadside sights along the way. I might do this someday. I would be 
camping or sleeping in the rental car.</li>
<br>
<li>In Reykjavik, there is a tenting campground next to the City Hostel.
 Outside Reykjavik, it is easy to sleep in a car or find a discreet 
tenting spot after dark. (You need a tent mainly because of rain.) Many 
tourists rent small campers, but I don't see the need for them.</li>
<br>
<li>Fast food is limited and expensive. KFC, Taco Bell and Dominoes are 
in the few big town. McDonalds, Burger King and all the others are 
nowhere to be seen.</li>
<br>
<li>Grocery shopping is done at chain supermarkets. (You rarely see a 
"mom and pop" store, even in small towns.) Iceland seems to have been 
Walmartted by the Bonus grocery store chain, but don't expect low 
prices. Prices range from 100-300% of U.S. prices. All your basic 
foodstuffs are available, but not much variety.</li>
<br>
<li>When driving, the usual European rules and signage applies. No left 
turn on a red light. Iceland stoplights do you the courtesy of showing 
red and yellow just before the green, but I don't understand why. Expect
 lots of roundabouts!</li>
<br>
<li>The airport is a good place to change money, both coming and going. 
There's no commission, and the spread is reasonable. This is especially 
handy when you have excess cash you need to get rid of at the end of 
your trip. (You change dollars/euros into Kroners outside security, but 
you change money in the other direction inside security.)</li>
<br>
<li>There are signs in the airport terminal saying you can't sleep 
there. The airport is in a lonely location 45km from the city. You'll 
have to either take a pricey bus or rent a car.</li>

 is this dude who lives entirely on the road, with no fixed residence. 
It started when he was laid off from his job as an airline baggage 
handler. The good news: He still got to fly for free for three more 
years without the inconvenience of working for it. The bad news: He had 
little money and couldn't afford to both travel and maintain a permanent
 home. The solution: He became deliberately homeless, finding ways to 
live comfortably and travel continuously while paying little or no rent.
 (He still has employment, but it doesn't require a fixed location.) 
This blog recounts some of the things he has learned along the way. It's
 all about freedom, creativity and finding clever ways to do what you 
want within the limited resources you have.</span>
